    "full_prose": "The luxury train, reminiscent of the famed Orient Express, chugged steadily along the tracks, its opulent interiors a stark contrast to the grim scene unfolding on the patio. Lumberjack, a young woman with a reputation for strength and determination, lay lifeless on the floor, the victim of a brutal crime. Detective Detecto, a seasoned investigator with a keen eye for detail, arrived at the scene, his thin frame and sharp gaze taking in every nuance of the setting. Only four people were present: Nurse, Trapper, Policeman, and Cook. It was clear that no one else could have been involved.\n\nDetecto began his investigation with a series of probing questions, his mind piecing together the puzzle from the fragments of information he gathered. Trapper, with her fiery red hair and gruff demeanor, had been embroiled in a heated argument with Lumberjack over territory and resources. The tension between them was palpable, and Detecto noted the potential motive simmering beneath Trapper's calm exterior. Nurse, however, insisted they had no access to the flamethrower, which was known to be Trapper's weapon of choice.\n\nThe dining car, where much of the evening's activity had taken place, was a riot of color, adorned with vibrant tablecloths and fresh flowers. A vintage clock on the wall chimed every hour, its melodic tones adding to the festive atmosphere. Cook, an elderly man with a passion for culinary arts, had a collection of vintage cookbooks that he often referred to for inspiration. Detecto observed a small dog wandering through the dining car, its nose twitching as it searched for scraps.\n\nStreamers and balloons hung from the ceiling, remnants of a celebration now overshadowed by tragedy. The secluded nature of the patio ensured that no one had witnessed the act, leaving Detecto to rely on the testimonies of those present. Cook suggested that Nurse had been too distracted to notice the brewing conflict outside, a claim that piqued Detecto's interest. Cook had seen Nurse moving around the dining car, diligently serving guests, their movements a blur of activity.\n\nCook's presence in the kitchen was corroborated by other staff members, who had been busy preparing the evening meal alongside him. Trapper, meanwhile, had mingled with the other passengers, her eyes keenly observing their reactions. Cook implied that Nurse's frantic behavior after the murder seemed suspicious, a detail that Detecto filed away for further consideration. Cook's apron, splattered with sauce, added to the air of suspicion surrounding his involvement in the incident.\n\nPoliceman, a young man with a clumsy streak, had stumbled over a nearby chair, drawing attention to himself and raising eyebrows among the onlookers. His uniform was pristine, free of any soot or burn marks, suggesting he had not been involved in the flamethrower incident on the patio. Detecto's mind raced as he weighed the evidence, each clue a thread in the intricate tapestry of the case.\n\nAs Detecto continued his inquiries, he noted the subtle shifts in demeanor among the suspects. Trapper's calm facade, Nurse's nervous insistence on innocence, Cook's meticulous recounting of his culinary duties, and Policeman's awkward attempts to deflect suspicion all played into the detective's growing understanding of the events. The train's rhythmic clatter seemed to echo the steady beat of Detecto's thoughts as he pieced together the narrative.\n\nDetecto's gaze lingered on the patio, the scene of the crime, as he considered the implications of each testimony. The flamethrower, a tool of destruction, had been wielded with intent, and Detecto knew that the truth lay hidden within the tangled web of relationships and motives. The detective's mind was a whirlwind of possibilities, each suspect's story a potential key to unlocking the mystery.\n\nWith each revelation, Detecto felt the pieces of the puzzle clicking into place. The train continued its journey, the landscape outside a blur as the detective's focus remained unwavering. He knew that the answer was within reach, the truth a whisper away from being uncovered. As the train sped onward, Detective Detecto prepared to reveal the identity of the murderer, confident in his deductions and ready to bring justice to the luxury train's ill-fated journey.",
