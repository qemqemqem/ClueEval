{"title": "The Manor's Muted Whispers", "full_prose": "Detective Detecto arrived at the isolated country manor, her tanned skin contrasting sharply with the somber scene that awaited her. The patio was a tableau of horror, the Journalist's lifeless body sprawled on the ground, a candlestick lying ominously beside him, its base stained with blood. The tranquility of the manor was shattered, and Detecto's keen eyes took in every detail, from the blood spatter to the position of the body.\n\nThere were only four people present at the manor: the Nurse, the Cook, the Accountant, and the Firefighter. No one else could possibly have been there, and Detecto knew that one of them held the key to unraveling this mystery. She began her investigation with her characteristic terse manner, probing into the lives of those present.\n\nThe Accountant, a redhead with a verbose nature, was the first to speak. \"I was admiring the vibrant paintings in the gallery,\" he protested, his voice steady but his eyes betraying a flicker of unease. Detecto noted his words, but her instincts told her there was more beneath the surface. She sensed the Accountant's racing thoughts, his mind a whirl of desperation to silence the Journalist once and for all.\n\nThe Cook, a muscular woman with a booming voice, recounted her evening in the kitchen. \"The sound of laughter and clinking glasses echoed from the living room,\" she said, her tone defensive. Detecto observed the half-prepared platter of snacks, untouched since the murder, and considered the Cook's absence from the patio suspicious. Yet, the evidence suggested she was not involved in the crime.\n\nThe Firefighter, short and stoic, spoke with a hint of sarcasm. \"I was in the gallery the entire time, engaged in conversation,\" she insisted, her alibi supported by witnesses who confirmed she had not left the group. Detecto noted the Firefighter's familiarity with the bow and arrow trophy, but her instincts told her the Firefighter had no intention of using it.\n\nThe Nurse, curly-haired and eccentric, whispered his account. \"A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the nearby trees as guests mingled outside,\" he murmured, his voice tinged with anxiety. Detecto sensed the Nurse's fear that the Journalist might expose a secret regarding the Journalist's health condition. His presence in the gallery, near the patio, made him a person of interest, but his access to medical supplies did not implicate him in the murder.\n\nDetecto's mind pieced together the fragments of the evening. The Accountant's demeanor, flustered and pale upon returning from the patio, stood out. The small fountain in the corner of the patio trickled softly, a serene backdrop to the chaos that had unfolded. The Cook had seen the Accountant's return, and her earlier actions of lingering in the kitchen seemed less suspicious in light of the untouched platter.\n\nAs Detecto gathered the final pieces of the puzzle, she knew the truth was within reach. It must be one of these suspects, and Detecto was certain she knew just who it was.", "question": "Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Journalist?", "options": {"A": "Nurse", "B": "Accountant", "C": "Cook", "D": "Firefighter"}, "killer": "Accountant", "reasoning": ["[AFTER_CRIME]\tThe Detective finds a half-prepared platter of snacks that Cook was working on, which had not been touched since the murder, indicating she was not involved in the crime.
