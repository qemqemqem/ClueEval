# Requiem for the Reverent Rabbi

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the remote island resort, her keen eyes immediately drawn to the lifeless body of the Bartender sprawled on the bedroom floor, a revolver lying ominously nearby amidst a pool of blood. As she surveyed the scene, she noted the presence of only four potential suspects: the Farmer, the Journalist, the Rabbi, and the Baker, each with their own alibis and secrets. 

Detecto began her investigation by questioning the Baker, who insisted on her innocence, claiming she was in the kitchen, focused on her pastries when the murder occurred. Witnesses corroborated the Baker's story, confirming her presence in the kitchen and her lack of suspicious behavior prior to the murder. Despite her protests, Detecto couldn't ignore the fact that the Baker had access to a knife, a potential weapon, though it seemed irrelevant given the use of a revolver.

The Baker's habit of humming a catchy jingle from a popular commercial while baking seemed innocuous, but Detecto filed it away as a detail that might later prove significant. Turning her attention to the Farmer, Detecto listened as he too protested his innocence, claiming he was in the greenhouse tending to his plants when the murder happened. The Farmer's story was supported by the sight of a butterfly that had momentarily distracted him, a detail that seemed too trivial to fabricate.

However, Detecto noticed the Farmer's freckled face turn pale as he overheard snippets of conversation about Bartender's death, a reaction that piqued her curiosity. The Farmer's access to a knife from the kitchen was noted, though like the Baker, he had no revolver. Meanwhile, the Journalist, with his camera in hand, insisted he was merely conducting interviews and had no motive to harm Bartender. Detecto found it interesting that the Journalist had overheard a guest complaining about the lack of fresh fruit at breakfast, a detail that seemed irrelevant but might later connect the dots.

The Journalist's photos, taken immediately after the gunshot, showed chaos in the common area, with timestamps indicating he was not in the bedroom at the time of the murder. As Detecto pieced together the clues, she turned her attention to the Rabbi, who mentioned his newfound interest in gardening and his excitement over his first tomato plants. The Rabbi's protests of innocence were met with Detecto's scrutiny, as she considered the possibility that he had stolen the revolver from the shed on the resort property.

Detecto's sharp instincts led her to uncover the Rabbi's motive: Bartender had discovered his embezzlement of funds from the synagogue's charity events and had threatened to expose him unless he paid her a substantial sum. The Rabbi's desperation and fear of losing his position had driven him to commit the unthinkable, a fact Detecto deduced from the Rabbi's nervous demeanor and the inconsistencies in his story. 

The murder had occurred when Bartender turned her back to grab a drink from the mini-fridge, a moment of vulnerability that the Rabbi had exploited. As Detecto continued her investigation, she noted the Baker's sudden appearance in the common area, which had aroused suspicion among the other guests. The Farmer's observation of the Rabbi acting strangely, trying to blend in while others were in shock, added another layer to the mystery.

In the common area, a guest's failed magic trick with a deck of cards seemed unrelated, yet Detecto remained vigilant, knowing that even the smallest detail could unravel the truth. The other guests began to whisper about the Journalist's motives, but Detecto focused on the evidence, knowing that the answer lay within the tangled web of alibis and secrets. As she prepared to reveal her findings, Detecto knew she was on the brink of solving the case, the truth just within her grasp.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Bartender?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Rabbi
- B: Farmer
- C: Journalist
- D: Baker

## Correct Answer

The killer is Rabbi

## Reasoning

- [DURING_CRIME]	I was in the greenhouse when the murder happened. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Farmer)
- [BEFORE_CRIME]	Witnesses in the kitchen confirmed that Baker was present and focused on her baking, with no indication of any suspicious behavior prior to the murder. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Baker)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	The photos taken by the Journalist immediately after the gunshot show the chaos in the common area, with timestamps indicating he was not in the bedroom at the time of the murder. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Journalist)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Rabbi wanted Bartender dead because she had discovered his secret: he was embezzling funds from the synagogue's charity events. Bartender had threatened to expose him unless he paid her a substantial sum to keep quiet. The pressure of maintaining his reputation and the fear of losing his position drove Rabbi to desperation. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Rabbi)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a revolver that Rabbi had stolen from the shed on the resort property. He had been planning to use it for protection against potential threats, but in a moment of panic and anger, he turned it against Bartender. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Rabbi)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Bartender was vulnerable to attack when she was alone in her bedroom, preparing for a night shift. Rabbi had been visiting her under the pretense of discussing a charity event, which allowed him to gain her trust and catch her off guard. The secluded nature of the resort meant there were no immediate witnesses. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Rabbi)

### Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a revolver that Rabbi had stolen from the shed on the resort property. He had been planning to use it for protection against potential threats, but in a moment of panic and anger, he turned it against Bartender.
Motive: Rabbi wanted Bartender dead because she had discovered his secret: he was embezzling funds from the synagogue's charity events. Bartender had threatened to expose him unless he paid her a substantial sum to keep quiet. The pressure of maintaining his reputation and the fear of losing his position drove Rabbi to desperation.
Opportunity: Bartender was vulnerable to attack when she was alone in her bedroom, preparing for a night shift. Rabbi had been visiting her under the pretense of discussing a charity event, which allowed him to gain her trust and catch her off guard. The secluded nature of the resort meant there were no immediate witnesses.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Rabbi and Bartender were engaged in a seemingly friendly conversation in her bedroom. They discussed the upcoming charity event, with Rabbi feigning enthusiasm while secretly feeling the weight of his deceit. Bartender, unaware of the true nature of their meeting, was relaxed and friendly, mumbling about her plans for the evening. The atmosphere was tense beneath the surface, as Rabbi's mind raced with thoughts of the money he owed her and the consequences of her threats.

The murder occurred when Bartender turned her back to grab a drink from the mini-fridge, leaving her momentarily vulnerable. In a sudden burst of panic, Rabbi drew the revolver from his coat pocket and shot her in the back. The sound of the gunshot echoed through the bedroom, and Bartender collapsed to the floor, lifeless. Rabbi stood frozen for a moment, shocked by his own actions, before quickly regaining his composure and disposing of the weapon in the shed.

After the murder, Rabbi hurriedly left the bedroom, his heart racing. He returned to the common area of the resort, attempting to act as if nothing had happened. He mingled with the other guests, feigning concern when the news of Bartender's death began to spread. Rabbi's stoic demeanor masked the turmoil within, as he plotted how to cover his tracks and deflect suspicion away from himself.


Story to Detective: 


I assure you, I had no reason to harm Bartender. We were simply discussing the charity event, and I was genuinely excited about it. I had been under a lot of pressure lately, what with the preparations and the expectations from the community. Bartender was a friend, and I valued her support. I remember her mumbling about her plans for the evening, and I was just trying to keep the conversation light and engaging. I would never have imagined that she would threaten me over money.

When I left her room, I was feeling relieved. I had no idea anything was wrong. I went to the common area to gather my thoughts and calm my nerves. I saw the other guests, and I thought it best to blend in and act as if everything was normal. I even joined in on a conversation about the weather, trying to distract myself from the mounting tension. It was a chaotic evening, and I was simply trying to navigate through it like everyone else.

I understand that the situation looks suspicious, but I assure you, I had nothing to do with her death. I was in my room for a while after our conversation, and I didn't hear anything unusual. I was shocked when I heard the commotion later on. I can only imagine how terrible it must have been for everyone involved. I hope you can see that I am just as devastated by this tragedy as anyone else.

### Parsed Story for Farmer

Means: Farmer has access to a knife from the kitchen but no revolver.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Farmer was in the greenhouse, tending to his plants, when the murder occurred.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Farmer was in the greenhouse, nervously tending to his plants. He had been struggling with his finances and was trying to distract himself from the mounting pressure of his debts. As he watered the plants and checked for pests, he occasionally glanced toward the main building, where he knew Bartender was preparing for the evening shift. He had hoped to speak with her about his financial troubles, but the thought of her reaction made him anxious.

When the murder occurred, Farmer was still in the greenhouse, completely unaware of the chaos unfolding in the bedroom. He was focused on his work, mumbling to himself about the plants and their needs. The sound of the gunshot startled him, causing him to drop his watering can. He stood frozen for a moment, his heart racing, but he quickly dismissed it as a part of the resort's usual noise, perhaps a door slamming or a guest dropping something.

Afterward, Farmer left the greenhouse and made his way to the common area, where he found a group of guests gathered, whispering in shock about Bartender's death. His freckled face turned pale as he overheard snippets of conversation, and he felt a wave of panic wash over him. He tried to blend in with the crowd, but his nervous demeanor and mumbling made him appear even more suspicious. He stood at the edge of the group, anxiously wringing his hands and glancing around for any sign of the Rabbi or the Detective.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was in the greenhouse when the murder happened. I was tending to my plants, trying to keep my mind off my financial troubles. I had no idea anything was wrong until I heard the gunshot, which startled me so much that I dropped my watering can. I thought it was just a noise from the resort, something typical, and I didn't think much of it at the time.

I mentioned that I had been hoping to speak with Bartender about my debts, but I was too nervous to approach her. I knew she was busy preparing for the evening, and I didn't want to burden her with my problems. I had no motive to harm her; in fact, I relied on her for support. I was just a simple farmer, trying to make ends meet, and I would never hurt anyone, especially not someone as kind as Bartender.

As I stood in the common area, I felt the weight of the situation pressing down on me. I noticed Rabbi acting strangely, trying to blend in while the others were in shock. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about him, but I knew I had to focus on my own innocence. I just wanted to go back to my plants and forget this nightmare.


### Parsed Story for Baker

Means: Baker has access to a knife from the kitchen, which could be seen as a potential weapon.
Motive: None
Opportunity: None

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Baker was in the resort's kitchen, preparing for the evening's dinner service. She was focused on baking a batch of her famous pastries, humming to herself as she mixed ingredients and rolled out dough. The aroma of freshly baked goods filled the air, and she was excited to share her creations with the guests. Although she had noticed Bartender's friendly demeanor earlier in the day, she was unaware of the brewing tension between Bartender and Rabbi.

When the murder occurred, Baker was still in the kitchen, engrossed in her work. The sound of the gunshot startled her, causing her to drop a tray of pastries. She quickly composed herself, thinking it was just a part of the resort's usual noise. Baker remained in the kitchen, trying to focus on her baking, but her mind raced with thoughts of the guests and their reactions to the sudden noise. She felt a twinge of anxiety, wondering if something was wrong, but she dismissed it as a typical evening at the resort.

Afterward, Baker left the kitchen to find out what had happened, her heart pounding with concern. As she entered the common area, she was met with a crowd of guests whispering in shock about Bartender's death. Baker's laid-back demeanor seemed out of place amidst the chaos, and she instinctively began to help calm the guests, offering them pastries to distract them from the grim news. However, her presence in the kitchen and her sudden appearance in the common area made her seem suspicious to others, as they began to wonder why she had been so close to the scene of the crime.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was in the kitchen preparing pastries when I heard the gunshot. I was completely focused on my baking and didn't even realize something was wrong until I dropped a tray of pastries. I mentioned that I had no reason to harm Bartender; in fact, I admired her and enjoyed our friendly chats. I was worried about how the news would affect the guests, which is why I rushed to the common area to see what was happening.

I also pointed out that while I had access to a knife in the kitchen, it was only for my baking. I had no intention of using it for anything else. I tried to emphasize that I had been in the kitchen the entire time and had no opportunity to commit the crime. I even suggested that Farmer, who was mumbling to himself in the greenhouse, might have been more suspicious given his nervous demeanor.

I concluded by expressing my concern for Bartender and the shock of the situation. I wanted to assure Detective Detecto that I had nothing to hide and that I was just a baker trying to do my job. I hoped that my innocence would be clear once the detective had a chance to investigate further.


### Parsed Story for Journalist

Means: Journalist has access to a camera, which could be used to document events but not as a weapon.
Motive: None
Opportunity: None

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Journalist was in the common area of the resort, interviewing guests for his latest article. He was particularly interested in the dynamics between the staff and the guests, hoping to uncover any hidden tensions that could make for a compelling story. As he moved from one group to another, he noticed the Rabbi and Bartender engaged in a private conversation, but he thought nothing of it at the time, focusing instead on gathering quotes and anecdotes from other guests.

When the murder occurred, Journalist was in the common area, just outside the bedroom door, preparing to approach the Rabbi for a comment on the charity event they were discussing. He heard the gunshot, which startled him, and he instinctively ducked behind a nearby potted plant, thinking it was part of a staged event or a prank. He remained hidden for a moment, trying to process what had just happened, and when he finally mustered the courage to peek out, he saw the Rabbi exiting the bedroom, looking visibly shaken.

After the gunshot, Journalist quickly emerged from his hiding spot and rushed to the scene, where he found a crowd gathering around Bartender's lifeless body. He began taking notes and snapping photos, hoping to capture the moment for his article. However, his sudden appearance and the fact that he had been lurking nearby made him seem suspicious to the other guests, who began to whisper about his motives and intentions.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was merely conducting interviews for a piece on the resort and its guests. I had no idea that anything sinister was happening in the bedroom, as I was focused on gathering information from other guests. When I heard the gunshot, I instinctively sought cover, fearing it was part of some chaotic event. I did not want to draw attention to myself, which is why I remained hidden for a moment.

I emphasized that I had no motive to harm Bartender, as I had only spoken to her earlier that day about her plans for the charity event. My interest in the Rabbi stemmed from my desire to understand the dynamics of the resort, not to implicate anyone in wrongdoing. I was simply a journalist trying to do my job, and I found it disheartening that my presence at the scene could be misconstrued as suspicious.

I also pointed out that Farmer and Baker were much closer to the scene of the crime than I was, and they had more reason to be involved in any potential conflict. I urged the detective to consider their actions and demeanor, as they seemed far more anxious and out of place than I did. My goal was to uncover the truth, not to create chaos or harm anyone.

### Full Prose Prompt

I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

# Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

This is a mystery story in the style of a golden age classic. The story features the following elements:

Victim: Bartender (a 60-year-old woman, pale and friendly, who speaks in a mumbling manner)
Killer: Rabbi (a 40-year-old man, lanky and stoic, who speaks in a enthusiastic manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 68-year-old woman, brunette and meticulous, who speaks in a terse manner)

Other Characters:
Farmer (a 65-year-old man, freckled and nervous, who speaks in a mumbling manner), Baker (a 28-year-old woman, average height and laid-back, who speaks in a booming manner), Journalist (a 23-year-old man, brunette and elegant, who speaks in a dramatic manner)

It Takes Place In: Remote island resort
The Crime Happened In: Bedroom
Other Locations in the Story: Greenhouse, Shed

The Murder Weapon: Revolver
Other Suspicious Items: Knife

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Revolver in the Bedroom by Rabbi, killing Bartender. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In this golden age mystery, Detective Detecto finds herself embroiled in a perplexing case on a remote island resort. When a beloved bartender is found dead, the unassuming Rabbi becomes the prime suspect. With a motley crew of characters and secrets hidden in every corner, Detecto must unravel the truth before more tragedy strikes.

Rabbi's Story to the Detective: 


I assure you, I had no reason to harm Bartender. We were simply discussing the charity event, and I was genuinely excited about it. I had been under a lot of pressure lately, what with the preparations and the expectations from the community. Bartender was a friend, and I valued her support. I remember her mumbling about her plans for the evening, and I was just trying to keep the conversation light and engaging. I would never have imagined that she would threaten me over money.

When I left her room, I was feeling relieved. I had no idea anything was wrong. I went to the common area to gather my thoughts and calm my nerves. I saw the other guests, and I thought it best to blend in and act as if everything was normal. I even joined in on a conversation about the weather, trying to distract myself from the mounting tension. It was a chaotic evening, and I was simply trying to navigate through it like everyone else.

I understand that the situation looks suspicious, but I assure you, I had nothing to do with her death. I was in my room for a while after our conversation, and I didn't hear anything unusual. I was shocked when I heard the commotion later on. I can only imagine how terrible it must have been for everyone involved. I hope you can see that I am just as devastated by this tragedy as anyone else.

Farmer's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was in the greenhouse when the murder happened. I was tending to my plants, trying to keep my mind off my financial troubles. I had no idea anything was wrong until I heard the gunshot, which startled me so much that I dropped my watering can. I thought it was just a noise from the resort, something typical, and I didn't think much of it at the time.

I mentioned that I had been hoping to speak with Bartender about my debts, but I was too nervous to approach her. I knew she was busy preparing for the evening, and I didn't want to burden her with my problems. I had no motive to harm her; in fact, I relied on her for support. I was just a simple farmer, trying to make ends meet, and I would never hurt anyone, especially not someone as kind as Bartender.

As I stood in the common area, I felt the weight of the situation pressing down on me. I noticed Rabbi acting strangely, trying to blend in while the others were in shock. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about him, but I knew I had to focus on my own innocence. I just wanted to go back to my plants and forget this nightmare.


Baker's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was in the kitchen preparing pastries when I heard the gunshot. I was completely focused on my baking and didn't even realize something was wrong until I dropped a tray of pastries. I mentioned that I had no reason to harm Bartender; in fact, I admired her and enjoyed our friendly chats. I was worried about how the news would affect the guests, which is why I rushed to the common area to see what was happening.

I also pointed out that while I had access to a knife in the kitchen, it was only for my baking. I had no intention of using it for anything else. I tried to emphasize that I had been in the kitchen the entire time and had no opportunity to commit the crime. I even suggested that Farmer, who was mumbling to himself in the greenhouse, might have been more suspicious given his nervous demeanor.

I concluded by expressing my concern for Bartender and the shock of the situation. I wanted to assure Detective Detecto that I had nothing to hide and that I was just a baker trying to do my job. I hoped that my innocence would be clear once the detective had a chance to investigate further.


Journalist's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was merely conducting interviews for a piece on the resort and its guests. I had no idea that anything sinister was happening in the bedroom, as I was focused on gathering information from other guests. When I heard the gunshot, I instinctively sought cover, fearing it was part of some chaotic event. I did not want to draw attention to myself, which is why I remained hidden for a moment.

I emphasized that I had no motive to harm Bartender, as I had only spoken to her earlier that day about her plans for the charity event. My interest in the Rabbi stemmed from my desire to understand the dynamics of the resort, not to implicate anyone in wrongdoing. I was simply a journalist trying to do my job, and I found it disheartening that my presence at the scene could be misconstrued as suspicious.

I also pointed out that Farmer and Baker were much closer to the scene of the crime than I was, and they had more reason to be involved in any potential conflict. I urged the detective to consider their actions and demeanor, as they seemed far more anxious and out of place than I did. My goal was to uncover the truth, not to create chaos or harm anyone.

# Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point.

### Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the remote island resort, her keen eyes immediately drawn to the lifeless body of the Bartender sprawled on the bedroom floor, a revolver lying ominously nearby amidst a pool of blood. As she surveyed the scene, she noted the presence of only four potential suspects: the Farmer, the Journalist, the Rabbi, and the Baker, each with their own alibis and secrets. 

Detecto began her investigation by questioning the Baker, who insisted on her innocence, claiming she was in the kitchen, focused on her pastries when the murder occurred. Witnesses corroborated the Baker's story, confirming her presence in the kitchen and her lack of suspicious behavior prior to the murder. Despite her protests, Detecto couldn't ignore the fact that the Baker had access to a knife, a potential weapon, though it seemed irrelevant given the use of a revolver.

The Baker's habit of humming a catchy jingle from a popular commercial while baking seemed innocuous, but Detecto filed it away as a detail that might later prove significant. Turning her attention to the Farmer, Detecto listened as he too protested his innocence, claiming he was in the greenhouse tending to his plants when the murder happened. The Farmer's story was supported by the sight of a butterfly that had momentarily distracted him, a detail that seemed too trivial to fabricate.

However, Detecto noticed the Farmer's freckled face turn pale as he overheard snippets of conversation about Bartender's death, a reaction that piqued her curiosity. The Farmer's access to a knife from the kitchen was noted, though like the Baker, he had no revolver. Meanwhile, the Journalist, with his camera in hand, insisted he was merely conducting interviews and had no motive to harm Bartender. Detecto found it interesting that the Journalist had overheard a guest complaining about the lack of fresh fruit at breakfast, a detail that seemed irrelevant but might later connect the dots.

The Journalist's photos, taken immediately after the gunshot, showed chaos in the common area, with timestamps indicating he was not in the bedroom at the time of the murder. As Detecto pieced together the clues, she turned her attention to the Rabbi, who mentioned his newfound interest in gardening and his excitement over his first tomato plants. The Rabbi's protests of innocence were met with Detecto's scrutiny, as she considered the possibility that he had stolen the revolver from the shed on the resort property.

Detecto's sharp instincts led her to uncover the Rabbi's motive: Bartender had discovered his embezzlement of funds from the synagogue's charity events and had threatened to expose him unless he paid her a substantial sum. The Rabbi's desperation and fear of losing his position had driven him to commit the unthinkable, a fact Detecto deduced from the Rabbi's nervous demeanor and the inconsistencies in his story. 

The murder had occurred when Bartender turned her back to grab a drink from the mini-fridge, a moment of vulnerability that the Rabbi had exploited. As Detecto continued her investigation, she noted the Baker's sudden appearance in the common area, which had aroused suspicion among the other guests. The Farmer's observation of the Rabbi acting strangely, trying to blend in while others were in shock, added another layer to the mystery.

In the common area, a guest's failed magic trick with a deck of cards seemed unrelated, yet Detecto remained vigilant, knowing that even the smallest detail could unravel the truth. The other guests began to whisper about the Journalist's motives, but Detecto focused on the evidence, knowing that the answer lay within the tangled web of alibis and secrets. As she prepared to reveal her findings, Detecto knew she was on the brink of solving the case, the truth just within her grasp.
