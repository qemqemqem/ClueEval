# The Exclusive Enigma

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the exclusive members-only club, their keen eyes immediately drawn to the lifeless body of Farmer sprawled across the ballroom floor, an arrow protruding from her chest, surrounded by a pool of crimson. The detective surveyed the scene with meticulous care, noting the four individuals present: Chauffeur, Baker, Nurse, and Fisherman, each with their own potential motives and alibis. 

Detecto began their investigation by questioning Baker, who vehemently protested her innocence, insisting, "I was in the lounge, chatting with other members about the dessert contest when it happened." Despite her protests, Detecto noted Baker's earlier tense exchange with Farmer over the quality of the club's produce, a detail that could not be ignored. 

As Detecto continued to probe, Baker casually mentioned, "While waiting for the event to start, I saw a stray cat outside the window and joked about how it looked like it was judging my baking skills." This seemingly innocuous comment did little to alleviate suspicion, but multiple witnesses confirmed Baker's presence in the lounge during the murder, providing her with a solid alibi.

Turning to the Chauffeur, Detecto listened as he recounted, "I had a spat with Farmer earlier about her complaints regarding the club's service, which left me feeling pretty irritated." The Chauffeur's annoyance was palpable, yet several club members vouched for his presence in the lounge, making it improbable for him to have slipped away unnoticed.

Fisherman, with a gravelly voice, admitted, "I had a tense exchange with Farmer about the fish served at the club, but I was just frustrated, not vengeful." Her words were underscored by the peculiar aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the scent of old wood in the lounge, a sensory detail that transported her back to her grandfather's fishing cabin. 

Detecto's attention then shifted to Nurse, who appeared absent-minded yet protested, "I was just in the lounge, chatting about upcoming events when it all happened." Despite his casual demeanor, Detecto observed Nurse's keen eyes, which betrayed a longstanding resentment towards Farmer due to her dismissive attitude and constant complaints. 

Detecto's suspicions deepened as they pieced together that Nurse had access to the club's archery equipment stored in the ballroom, a fact he had conveniently omitted. The lively atmosphere of the club event provided the perfect cover for Nurse to strike unnoticed, a realization that dawned on Detecto as they recalled Nurse's earlier comment about a painting of a cat wearing a monocle that always made him chuckle.

As the investigation unfolded, Detecto noted Fisherman's earlier confrontation with Farmer, which cast a shadow of suspicion over her, despite her insistence, "I was completely unaware of what was going on in the ballroom." Her protestations were echoed by the decorative fish tank she noticed upon entering the ballroom, filled with vibrant tropical fish, a detail that seemed to momentarily distract her from the gravity of the situation.

With each suspect's story meticulously dissected, Detecto's mind whirred with the possibilities, each piece of evidence carefully weighed and considered. The detective's eyes scanned the room one final time, confident in their deductions, ready to reveal the truth behind Farmer's untimely demise.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Farmer?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Fisherman
- B: Baker
- C: Nurse
- D: Chauffeur

## Correct Answer

The killer is Nurse

## Reasoning

- [DURING_CRIME]	I was completely unaware of what was going on in the ballroom. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Fisherman)
- [DURING_CRIME]	Baker was seen by multiple witnesses in the lounge, engaged in conversation, during the time of the murder, providing her with a solid alibi. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Baker)
- [DURING_CRIME]	Several club members can confirm that the Chauffeur was present and busy when the murder occurred, making it impossible for him to have left the lounge unnoticed. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Chauffeur)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Nurse had a longstanding resentment towards Farmer due to her dismissive attitude towards the elderly and her constant complaints about the club's services, which Nurse felt were unfairly directed at him. This resentment festered over time, leading Nurse to believe that eliminating Farmer would restore peace to the club and improve the atmosphere for everyone else. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Nurse)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a bow and arrow, which Nurse had access to as a part of the club's archery equipment. The weapon was typically stored in the ballroom, where members often engaged in recreational activities. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Nurse)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Farmer was vulnerable to attack during a club event in the ballroom, where she was distracted by her conversation with other members. The atmosphere was lively, and the noise masked any potential sounds of struggle or distress, providing Nurse with the perfect moment to strike. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Nurse)
