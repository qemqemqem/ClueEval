I'm writing a mystery story. Here's a summary of what it involves:

{{summary}}

I know what happened with the central story, the actual murder. Here's a summary of that:

{{murder_summary}}

I also know a little bit about what happens to some of the other characters.

{{other_stories}}

Now, I want to focus on {{character}}. What were they doing in all this? They were innocent, but their actions make them seem suspicious.

Write a three paragraph story detailing what {{character}} was doing in all this. Write a summary of their actions, keeping in mind that they are innocent but suspicious. Write clearly and stick to the facts, because this is for my notes, not for the reader. {{character}} has either a Motive and Means but no Opportunity, or an Opportunity and Means but no Motive, or an Opportunity and Motive but no Means. They do not have all three.

Make sure this character acts suspiciously, as befits a real murder mystery!

Fill out this form:

# Details

Secret: What secret is {{character}} trying to hide?
Motive: Why did the character want the victim dead? (or simply write "None")
Means: What weapon or method did they have available? (or simply write "None")
Opportunity: When was the victim vulnerable to attack? (or simply write "None")

# What Happened

Then write a three paragraph story describing what {{character}} was up to in all this. The first paragraph should outline what they were doing before the murder, the second paragraph should explain where they were when the murder occurred, and the third paragraph should explain what they did afterward.

# Explanation to Detective

The detective in my story interviews each of the characters. Write a 3 paragraph story which {{character}} would give to the detective, in which they try to explain themself. Keep this as an outline and don't use dialog.
