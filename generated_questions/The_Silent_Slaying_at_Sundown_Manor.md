# The Silent Slaying at Sundown Manor

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the secluded country estate, her mind already swirling with the possibilities as she approached the scene of the crime. In the classroom, the lifeless body of the Shopkeeper lay sprawled on the floor, a gruesome sight with the antique sword protruding from her chest, blood pooling beneath her. Only four people were present at the estate: the Nurse, the Bartender, the Waiter, and the Gardener, and no one else could have been involved. Detecto began her investigation, her sing-song voice cutting through the tension as she questioned each suspect.

The Bartender, a tall and mean woman, protested her innocence, insisting she had been busy mixing drinks and had no knowledge of the murder. Detecto noticed a bow and arrow concealed behind the bar, though it appeared unused, raising questions about its purpose. The Gardener, a fat and clumsy woman, recounted a humorous incident from last month when she dropped a weight on her foot, but Detecto's keen eye caught her nervous glances toward the classroom where the antique sword was displayed. The Gardener claimed she was in the gym during the murder, stretching by the large window overlooking the blooming garden, yet Detecto couldn't ignore her access to the sword.

The Nurse, a blonde woman with a stutter, nervously paced the hallway outside the classroom, rehearsing her words for Shopkeeper. Detecto sensed something amiss in the Nurse's demeanor, her flustered state hinting at deeper motives. The Waiter, awkward and mumbling, confessed to being in the drawing room, engaged in conversation with the Bartender and Gardener, unable to attack Shopkeeper. Detecto noted the Waiter's access to the sword, as she sometimes helped set up for workshops in the classroom.

The Bartender mentioned seeing the Nurse return from the classroom looking flustered, a detail that piqued Detecto's interest. Despite the Bartender's protests, there were no traces of blood or signs she had handled the sword, though the cheerful tune from the bar's jukebox seemed oddly out of place. The Gardener reiterated her innocence, her flustered demeanor and access to the sword casting shadows of doubt. After her workout, she was surprised to find her favorite snack bar still in her gym bag, a small detail that seemed irrelevant but stuck in Detecto's mind.

The Waiter expressed guilt for not protecting Shopkeeper, her jokes about cheese names failing to mask her unease. As Detecto pieced together the clues, she realized it must be one of these suspects, and she knew just who it was.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Shopkeeper?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Gardener
- B: Waiter
- C: Nurse
- D: Bartender

## Correct Answer

The killer is Nurse

## Reasoning

- [DURING_CRIME]	I was engaged in conversation with the Bartender and Gardener during the time of the murder. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Waiter)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	There were no traces of blood or any signs that the bartender had been in the classroom or handled the murder weapon, the antique sword. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Bartender)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	I reiterated that I had no motive to harm Shopkeeper. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Gardener)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Nurse wanted Shopkeeper dead because she believed that Shopkeeper was spreading malicious rumors about her past, which had caused her to lose her job at the local hospital. The humiliation and shame from these rumors had left Nurse feeling isolated and desperate, leading her to see Shopkeeper as a direct threat to her reputation and livelihood. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Nurse)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using an antique sword that was displayed in the classroom as part of a historical collection. The sword was sharp and heavy, making it a lethal weapon in the hands of someone determined to kill. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Nurse)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Shopkeeper was vulnerable to attack during a quiet afternoon when she was alone in the classroom, preparing for a community workshop. The other characters were occupied in different parts of the estate, and the isolation of the classroom provided Nurse with the perfect opportunity to confront Shopkeeper without interruption. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Nurse)

### Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using an antique sword that was displayed in the classroom as part of a historical collection. The sword was sharp and heavy, making it a lethal weapon in the hands of someone determined to kill.
Motive: Nurse wanted Shopkeeper dead because she believed that Shopkeeper was spreading malicious rumors about her past, which had caused her to lose her job at the local hospital. The humiliation and shame from these rumors had left Nurse feeling isolated and desperate, leading her to see Shopkeeper as a direct threat to her reputation and livelihood.
Opportunity: Shopkeeper was vulnerable to attack during a quiet afternoon when she was alone in the classroom, preparing for a community workshop. The other characters were occupied in different parts of the estate, and the isolation of the classroom provided Nurse with the perfect opportunity to confront Shopkeeper without interruption.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Nurse had been pacing nervously in the hallway outside the classroom, rehearsing what she would say to Shopkeeper. She had overheard Shopkeeper gossiping with other guests about her past, and the thought of confronting her filled Nurse with a mix of anger and fear. As she gathered her courage, she decided that she needed to put an end to the rumors once and for all. She took a deep breath and entered the classroom, where Shopkeeper was busy arranging materials for the workshop.

Inside the classroom, Nurse confronted Shopkeeper about the rumors, her stuttering voice barely masking her rage. Shopkeeper, startled and defensive, attempted to deny the accusations, but Nurse’s frustration boiled over. In a moment of impulsive violence, she grabbed the antique sword from its display and struck Shopkeeper, who had turned to flee. The blow was swift and brutal, and Shopkeeper collapsed to the floor, lifeless. The room fell silent, the only sound being the echo of Nurse’s heavy breathing as she realized the gravity of her actions.

After the murder, Nurse panicked and quickly cleaned the scene, wiping down the sword and placing it back in its display. She then left the classroom, trying to compose herself as she rejoined the other characters in the drawing room. To mask her anxiety, she engaged in small talk, all the while her mind raced with thoughts of what she had done. She felt a mixture of relief and dread, convinced that no one would suspect her, and determined to maintain her innocence at all costs.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the drawing room, minding my own business, when I heard a commotion coming from the classroom. I had no idea what was going on, but I thought it best to stay out of it. I had been feeling anxious all day, and the last thing I wanted was to get involved in any drama. I was just trying to keep my head down and avoid any trouble. I didn’t even know Shopkeeper was in there until I heard her voice raised in anger. It was unsettling, but I figured it was just a misunderstanding.

When I finally gathered the courage to check on Shopkeeper, I found her in the classroom, but I swear I didn’t see anything unusual. I was just there to make sure everything was alright. I remember thinking how strange it was that she was alone, but I didn’t think much of it. I was just trying to be helpful, you know? I didn’t see the sword or anything like that. I was just there for a moment, and then I left. I didn’t want to get caught up in whatever was happening. I mean, who would want to be involved in such a mess?

I know people are saying I might have had something to do with it, but that’s just ridiculous. I was just trying to help, and I didn’t even know what was happening until it was too late. I’m not the kind of person who would hurt anyone. I’ve had my share of troubles, but I would never resort to violence. I just want to clear my name and move on from this whole ordeal. I’m innocent, and I hope you can see that.

### Parsed Story for Waiter

Means: Waiter had access to the antique sword, as it was displayed in the classroom where she sometimes helped set up for workshops.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Waiter was in the drawing room, engaged in conversation with other guests, when the murder occurred, making her unable to attack Shopkeeper.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Waiter was busy preparing refreshments in the kitchen, feeling anxious about the upcoming workshop. She had overheard snippets of gossip about Shopkeeper and was troubled by the rumors circulating among the guests. As she arranged the snacks, she found herself daydreaming about confessing her feelings to Shopkeeper, but her awkwardness held her back. She decided to take a break and wandered toward the drawing room, hoping to gather her thoughts and perhaps catch a glimpse of Shopkeeper.

When the murder occurred, Waiter was in the drawing room, chatting with the Bartender and Gardener. They were discussing the upcoming events at the estate, and Waiter was trying to keep her mind off her feelings for Shopkeeper. She noticed that the atmosphere in the drawing room shifted as the other guests began to murmur about the sudden silence from the classroom. Waiter felt a knot of anxiety in her stomach but remained oblivious to the true nature of the events unfolding just a few doors away.

After the murder, Waiter felt a sense of dread wash over her as she noticed the tension in the drawing room. When Nurse rejoined them, she seemed unusually flustered, which made Waiter even more anxious. She tried to engage in small talk to distract herself from the growing unease, but her mind kept drifting back to Shopkeeper. As the guests began to gather and discuss what might have happened, Waiter felt a pang of guilt for not having been there to protect Shopkeeper, even though she had no idea that danger was lurking just moments before.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was in the kitchen preparing snacks for the workshop before the murder occurred. I was feeling nervous about the event and had overheard some gossip about Shopkeeper that made me uneasy. I wanted to talk to her about it, but I was too shy to approach her directly. Instead, I decided to take a break and went to the drawing room to gather my thoughts and calm my nerves. I was there when the murder happened, completely unaware of what was going on in the classroom.

I mentioned that I was engaged in conversation with the Bartender and Gardener during the time of the murder. We were discussing the upcoming events, and I was trying to keep my mind off my feelings for Shopkeeper. I noticed that the atmosphere shifted when the other guests began to murmur about the silence from the classroom, but I had no idea that something terrible had happened. I felt a knot of anxiety in my stomach, but I didn’t think anything was wrong until Nurse returned looking flustered.

After the murder, I tried to act normal and engage in small talk, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of dread. I felt guilty for not being there for Shopkeeper, even though I had no idea she was in danger. I wanted to help, but I was too caught up in my own feelings and fears. I hope that Detective Detecto can see that I had no motive to harm Shopkeeper, only a desire to support her, even if I never found the courage to express my feelings.


### Parsed Story for Bartender

Means: Bow and arrow (though she did not use it)
Motive: None
Opportunity: None

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Bartender was busy preparing drinks in the bar area of the estate. She was focused on mixing cocktails and ensuring that everything was ready for the guests’ enjoyment during the workshop. As she worked, she overheard snippets of conversation from the drawing room, where the other guests were gossiping about Shopkeeper. Bartender felt a sense of disdain for the idle chatter, but she kept her head down, concentrating on her tasks to avoid getting involved in the drama.

When the murder occurred, Bartender was still in the bar area, mixing drinks and occasionally glancing toward the drawing room. She noticed that the atmosphere had shifted, with guests becoming increasingly restless and whispering among themselves. However, she remained unaware of the actual events taking place in the classroom, as she was preoccupied with her work and the demands of the guests. The sound of muffled voices and laughter from the drawing room masked the tension building just a few doors away.

After the murder, Bartender sensed the sudden change in mood when guests began to gather and murmur about the silence from the classroom. She decided to step out from behind the bar to see what was happening, but as she approached the drawing room, she noticed Nurse returning from the direction of the classroom, looking flustered. Bartender felt a chill run down her spine, and her instincts told her to keep her distance. Instead, she resumed her duties, pouring drinks and attempting to maintain a façade of normalcy while her mind raced with questions about the sudden shift in atmosphere.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was simply doing my job in the bar area before the murder occurred. I was focused on preparing drinks and overheard some gossip about Shopkeeper, which I found distasteful. I made a conscious effort to ignore it and concentrate on my work, as I didn’t want to get involved in the drama. I was unaware of any danger until the atmosphere shifted, and I noticed the guests becoming restless.

I was in the bar area when the murder took place, and I didn’t hear anything unusual from the classroom. I was busy mixing cocktails and serving drinks, so I had no idea that something terrible had happened until I saw the guests gathering and whispering. When I saw Nurse come back from the classroom looking flustered, I felt uneasy, but I didn’t think much of it at the time. I just wanted to keep my head down and focus on my work.

After the murder, I tried to act normal and continued serving drinks, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. I noticed the tension in the room and felt a sense of dread. I didn’t want to draw attention to myself, so I kept pouring drinks and engaging in small talk with the guests. I had no motive to harm Shopkeeper, and I was just trying to do my job while everyone else was caught up in the chaos.


### Parsed Story for Gardener

Means: Gardener has access to the antique sword, as it is displayed in the classroom where she often tends to the plants.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Gardener was in the gym at the time of the murder, engaged in a workout routine.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Gardener was in the gym, tending to her physical fitness as a way to cope with the stress of the estate's social dynamics. She was lifting weights and practicing her stretches, trying to clear her mind of the tumultuous feelings she had for Shopkeeper. While she was focused on her workout, she overheard snippets of gossip from the drawing room about Shopkeeper, which made her feel uneasy but also determined to keep her distance from the drama.

When the murder occurred, Gardener was still in the gym, completely unaware of the events unfolding in the classroom. She was engrossed in her routine, occasionally glancing at the clock, which made her lose track of time. The muffled sounds of laughter and chatter from the drawing room masked the tension building just a few doors away, and Gardener remained oblivious to the danger that was lurking nearby.

After the murder, Gardener finished her workout and decided to head to the drawing room to join the others. As she entered, she noticed a sudden shift in the atmosphere; the guests were whispering and casting anxious glances toward the classroom. Feeling a knot of anxiety in her stomach, Gardener tried to engage in small talk, but her mind was racing with concern for Shopkeeper. When Nurse returned from the classroom, looking flustered, Gardener felt a chill run down her spine, sensing that something was terribly wrong.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was in the gym the entire time leading up to the murder. I was focused on my workout, trying to keep my mind off the gossip I had overheard about Shopkeeper. I had no idea that anything was happening in the classroom until I walked into the drawing room and felt the tension in the air. I mentioned that I often tend to the plants in the classroom, but I never had any intention of harming Shopkeeper. My feelings for her are complicated, and I would never act on them in such a violent manner.

I also pointed out that Nurse had been acting strangely when she returned from the classroom. Her flustered demeanor caught my attention, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about her. I suggested that perhaps Nurse had been the one to confront Shopkeeper, given the rumors circulating among the guests. I felt it was important to share my observations, as they might help the detective piece together the timeline of events.

Finally, I reiterated that I had no motive to harm Shopkeeper. My feelings for her were rooted in admiration, not malice. I wanted to assure Detective Detecto that I was simply an innocent bystander in this tragic situation, and I hoped that my alibi would help clear my name. I was genuinely concerned for Shopkeeper and wanted to see justice served.

### Full Prose Prompt

I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

# Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

This is a mystery story in the style of a golden age classic. The story features the following elements:

Victim: Shopkeeper (a 38-year-old woman, muscular and nervous, who speaks in a mumbling manner)
Killer: Nurse (a 32-year-old woman, blonde and stuttering, who speaks in a blunt manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 25-year-old woman, thin and absent-minded, who speaks in a sing-song manner)

Other Characters:
Waiter (a 23-year-old woman, fat and awkward, who speaks in a mumbling manner), Bartender (a 18-year-old woman, tall and mean, who speaks in a sing-song manner), Gardener (a 59-year-old woman, fat and clumsy, who speaks in a blunt manner)

It Takes Place In: Secluded country estate
The Crime Happened In: Classroom
Other Locations in the Story: Drawing Room, Gym

The Murder Weapon: Antique Sword
Other Suspicious Items: Bow And Arrow

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Antique Sword in the Classroom by Nurse, killing Shopkeeper. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In the tranquility of a secluded country estate, a brutal murder shatters the peace, with a shopkeeper found slain by an antique sword in a seemingly innocent classroom. Young and perceptive Detective Detecto must unravel a web of secrets and deception, where a stuttering nurse and a selection of enigmatic characters all hold a piece of the puzzle.

Nurse's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the drawing room, minding my own business, when I heard a commotion coming from the classroom. I had no idea what was going on, but I thought it best to stay out of it. I had been feeling anxious all day, and the last thing I wanted was to get involved in any drama. I was just trying to keep my head down and avoid any trouble. I didn’t even know Shopkeeper was in there until I heard her voice raised in anger. It was unsettling, but I figured it was just a misunderstanding.

When I finally gathered the courage to check on Shopkeeper, I found her in the classroom, but I swear I didn’t see anything unusual. I was just there to make sure everything was alright. I remember thinking how strange it was that she was alone, but I didn’t think much of it. I was just trying to be helpful, you know? I didn’t see the sword or anything like that. I was just there for a moment, and then I left. I didn’t want to get caught up in whatever was happening. I mean, who would want to be involved in such a mess?

I know people are saying I might have had something to do with it, but that’s just ridiculous. I was just trying to help, and I didn’t even know what was happening until it was too late. I’m not the kind of person who would hurt anyone. I’ve had my share of troubles, but I would never resort to violence. I just want to clear my name and move on from this whole ordeal. I’m innocent, and I hope you can see that.

Waiter's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was in the kitchen preparing snacks for the workshop before the murder occurred. I was feeling nervous about the event and had overheard some gossip about Shopkeeper that made me uneasy. I wanted to talk to her about it, but I was too shy to approach her directly. Instead, I decided to take a break and went to the drawing room to gather my thoughts and calm my nerves. I was there when the murder happened, completely unaware of what was going on in the classroom.

I mentioned that I was engaged in conversation with the Bartender and Gardener during the time of the murder. We were discussing the upcoming events, and I was trying to keep my mind off my feelings for Shopkeeper. I noticed that the atmosphere shifted when the other guests began to murmur about the silence from the classroom, but I had no idea that something terrible had happened. I felt a knot of anxiety in my stomach, but I didn’t think anything was wrong until Nurse returned looking flustered.

After the murder, I tried to act normal and engage in small talk, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of dread. I felt guilty for not being there for Shopkeeper, even though I had no idea she was in danger. I wanted to help, but I was too caught up in my own feelings and fears. I hope that Detective Detecto can see that I had no motive to harm Shopkeeper, only a desire to support her, even if I never found the courage to express my feelings.


Bartender's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was simply doing my job in the bar area before the murder occurred. I was focused on preparing drinks and overheard some gossip about Shopkeeper, which I found distasteful. I made a conscious effort to ignore it and concentrate on my work, as I didn’t want to get involved in the drama. I was unaware of any danger until the atmosphere shifted, and I noticed the guests becoming restless.

I was in the bar area when the murder took place, and I didn’t hear anything unusual from the classroom. I was busy mixing cocktails and serving drinks, so I had no idea that something terrible had happened until I saw the guests gathering and whispering. When I saw Nurse come back from the classroom looking flustered, I felt uneasy, but I didn’t think much of it at the time. I just wanted to keep my head down and focus on my work.

After the murder, I tried to act normal and continued serving drinks, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. I noticed the tension in the room and felt a sense of dread. I didn’t want to draw attention to myself, so I kept pouring drinks and engaging in small talk with the guests. I had no motive to harm Shopkeeper, and I was just trying to do my job while everyone else was caught up in the chaos.


Gardener's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was in the gym the entire time leading up to the murder. I was focused on my workout, trying to keep my mind off the gossip I had overheard about Shopkeeper. I had no idea that anything was happening in the classroom until I walked into the drawing room and felt the tension in the air. I mentioned that I often tend to the plants in the classroom, but I never had any intention of harming Shopkeeper. My feelings for her are complicated, and I would never act on them in such a violent manner.

I also pointed out that Nurse had been acting strangely when she returned from the classroom. Her flustered demeanor caught my attention, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about her. I suggested that perhaps Nurse had been the one to confront Shopkeeper, given the rumors circulating among the guests. I felt it was important to share my observations, as they might help the detective piece together the timeline of events.

Finally, I reiterated that I had no motive to harm Shopkeeper. My feelings for her were rooted in admiration, not malice. I wanted to assure Detective Detecto that I was simply an innocent bystander in this tragic situation, and I hoped that my alibi would help clear my name. I was genuinely concerned for Shopkeeper and wanted to see justice served.

# Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point.

### Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the secluded country estate, her mind already swirling with the possibilities as she approached the scene of the crime. In the classroom, the lifeless body of the Shopkeeper lay sprawled on the floor, a gruesome sight with the antique sword protruding from her chest, blood pooling beneath her. Only four people were present at the estate: the Nurse, the Bartender, the Waiter, and the Gardener, and no one else could have been involved. Detecto began her investigation, her sing-song voice cutting through the tension as she questioned each suspect.

The Bartender, a tall and mean woman, protested her innocence, insisting she had been busy mixing drinks and had no knowledge of the murder. Detecto noticed a bow and arrow concealed behind the bar, though it appeared unused, raising questions about its purpose. The Gardener, a fat and clumsy woman, recounted a humorous incident from last month when she dropped a weight on her foot, but Detecto's keen eye caught her nervous glances toward the classroom where the antique sword was displayed. The Gardener claimed she was in the gym during the murder, stretching by the large window overlooking the blooming garden, yet Detecto couldn't ignore her access to the sword.

The Nurse, a blonde woman with a stutter, nervously paced the hallway outside the classroom, rehearsing her words for Shopkeeper. Detecto sensed something amiss in the Nurse's demeanor, her flustered state hinting at deeper motives. The Waiter, awkward and mumbling, confessed to being in the drawing room, engaged in conversation with the Bartender and Gardener, unable to attack Shopkeeper. Detecto noted the Waiter's access to the sword, as she sometimes helped set up for workshops in the classroom.

The Bartender mentioned seeing the Nurse return from the classroom looking flustered, a detail that piqued Detecto's interest. Despite the Bartender's protests, there were no traces of blood or signs she had handled the sword, though the cheerful tune from the bar's jukebox seemed oddly out of place. The Gardener reiterated her innocence, her flustered demeanor and access to the sword casting shadows of doubt. After her workout, she was surprised to find her favorite snack bar still in her gym bag, a small detail that seemed irrelevant but stuck in Detecto's mind.

The Waiter expressed guilt for not protecting Shopkeeper, her jokes about cheese names failing to mask her unease. As Detecto pieced together the clues, she realized it must be one of these suspects, and she knew just who it was.
