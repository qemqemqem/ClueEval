# Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a candlestick, which was readily available in the auditorium where the two women often interacted.
Motive: Artist felt overshadowed by Priest's charm and popularity. She believed that Priest's presence stifled her creativity and drew attention away from her work, leading to feelings of jealousy and resentment.
Opportunity: Priest was vulnerable during a late-night rehearsal for a charity event, when the auditorium was empty and the atmosphere was tense, allowing Artist to approach without being noticed.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Artist was in her studio, surrounded by her unfinished paintings, feeling increasingly frustrated by the attention Priest received from the other guests at the resort. She had overheard conversations praising Priest's charm and wit, which only deepened her resentment. As the evening approached, Artist decided to attend the rehearsal in the auditorium, where she knew Priest would be preparing for the charity event. She felt a mix of determination and anxiety, knowing that this was her chance to confront the source of her frustration.

In the dimly lit auditorium, the atmosphere was thick with anticipation. Priest was rehearsing her speech, unaware of Artist's presence as she entered the room. The two women had shared a complicated relationship, filled with veiled compliments and thinly disguised animosity. As Priest practiced her lines, Artist approached her from behind, gripping the heavy candlestick tightly. In a moment of heated emotion, Artist struck Priest, silencing her forever. The act was swift, driven by a surge of jealousy and a desire to reclaim her own identity.

After the murder, Artist quickly composed herself, placing the candlestick back on the table where it had been. She stepped back into the shadows, allowing the silence to envelop her. Once she was certain that no one had witnessed the act, she left the auditorium and returned to her studio, feigning innocence. Artist spent the rest of the night working on her paintings, trying to distract herself from the gravity of her actions, all while maintaining a façade of normalcy as the other guests began to gather for the event.


Story to Detective: 


I was in my studio, working on my latest piece, when I decided to attend the rehearsal in the auditorium. I had heard that Priest would be there, and I thought it might be a good opportunity to confront her about the way she overshadowed my work. I felt a surge of frustration as I listened to the praise she received from others, and I wanted to express my feelings. I thought perhaps if I could just talk to her, I could make her understand how her presence affected me. It was a simple decision, really, just to go and see her.

When I arrived at the auditorium, it was dark and quiet, with only the sound of Priest rehearsing her speech. I stood in the shadows, watching her, and I felt a mix of emotions. I wanted to tell her how I felt, but the words wouldn’t come. Instead, I picked up the candlestick, which was just sitting there, and I thought about how heavy it felt in my hands. I didn’t intend for anything to happen; I just wanted to express my frustration. But then, in a moment of anger, I struck her. It all happened so fast, and I didn’t really think about what I was doing.

Afterward, I was in shock. I put the candlestick back where it belonged, trying to act as if nothing had happened. I left the auditorium and returned to my studio, where I tried to focus on my paintings. I thought if I could just immerse myself in my work, I could forget about the incident. I didn’t want anyone to suspect me, so I made sure to act normal. I didn’t see anyone else around, and I thought I had gotten away with it. I’m just an artist, trying to create, and I don’t understand why I’m being questioned like this.

# Parsed Story for Sailor

Means: Sailor had access to a shovel she was using in the garden, which could be seen as a potential weapon.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Sailor was in the garden, tending to her plants, during the time of the murder.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Sailor was in the garden of the resort, tending to her beloved flowers and herbs. She had been lost in thought, contemplating her memoir and the fear of how others might perceive her writing. Sailor often spoke to her plants as if they were her confidants, and on this particular evening, she was especially animated, discussing her dreams and aspirations with them. This behavior, while innocent, made her seem distracted and absent-minded to anyone who might have passed by.

When the murder occurred, Sailor was still in the garden, completely unaware of the events unfolding in the auditorium. She was focused on her work, digging and planting, and the sounds of the rehearsal had faded into the background. The isolation of the garden provided her with a perfect cover, but it also meant that she had no idea that Priest was in danger. Sailor's absence from the auditorium during the critical moment raised eyebrows, as it could be interpreted as an opportunity to commit the crime without being seen.

After the murder, Sailor returned to the main building, still preoccupied with her gardening. She was startled to find guests gathering and whispering about the tragedy that had just occurred. Sailor's mind raced as she tried to piece together what had happened, but her absent-mindedness made her seem even more suspicious. She attempted to engage with the other guests, but her nervousness and the dirt on her hands from the garden made her appear guilty, despite her innocence.


Story to Detective: 


As I sit here, I must express my utter shock at the events that have transpired. I was in the garden, you see, tending to my plants, which I find to be a most calming activity. I often lose track of time when I’m with them, and on that fateful evening, I was deep in thought about my memoir. I had been talking to my flowers, sharing my hopes and dreams, completely unaware of the chaos that was unfolding in the auditorium. I assure you, my focus was solely on my gardening, and I had no reason to wish harm upon Priest.

Now, I understand that my absence from the auditorium during the time of the murder may raise questions. However, I must emphasize that I was in the garden, and I did not hear any commotion or cries for help. I was so engrossed in my work that I didn’t even notice the time passing. It’s quite possible that someone else, perhaps the Artist, could have been lurking nearby, given her known jealousy towards Priest. I would never harm anyone, especially not someone as charming as Priest, who I admired from a distance.

I must confess, I did have a shovel in my hands, which I was using for my gardening. I can see how that might look suspicious, but I assure you, it was merely a tool for my plants. I had no intention of using it for anything other than digging. I hope you can understand my innocence in this matter, and I implore you to consider the possibility that someone else, like the Artist, had a motive far more compelling than my own innocent gardening.


# Parsed Story for Guard

Means: Guard had access to the candlestick, as it was in the auditorium where she was present before the rehearsal began.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Guard was in the auditorium before the murder, but she left to check on the guests in the garden, making her absence during the critical moment suspicious.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Guard was in the auditorium, preparing for the charity event. She was ensuring that everything was in order, checking the seating arrangements and the lighting. Her tall, energetic presence was a comforting sight for the guests who were arriving. However, she was also keeping an eye on the interactions between Priest and Artist, sensing the tension that simmered beneath their cordial exchanges. Guard had a keen intuition for conflict, which made her more observant than most.

When the murder occurred, Guard had stepped out of the auditorium to attend to some guests who had wandered into the garden. She was engaged in conversation with a couple of attendees, discussing the event and the beautiful surroundings. The sounds of the rehearsal faded away, and she was completely unaware of the violent act that had just taken place. This absence from the auditorium during the critical moment raised eyebrows, as it could be interpreted as an opportunity to commit the crime, even though she was genuinely preoccupied with her duties.

After the murder, Guard returned to the auditorium, only to be met with chaos and confusion. Guests were whispering in shock, and the atmosphere was thick with tension. Guard immediately began to assist in managing the situation, trying to calm the guests and gather information about what had happened. Her energetic demeanor and articulate speech made her seem authoritative, but her involvement in the chaos also made her appear suspicious, as if she were trying to cover something up.


Story to Detective: 


As I recount the events of that evening, I must emphasize my role as the guard of the event. I was in the auditorium, ensuring everything was prepared for the charity event. I had noticed the tension between Priest and Artist, but I thought it was merely a creative rivalry. I stepped out to check on the guests in the garden, as it was my duty to ensure everyone felt welcomed and attended to. I was engaged in conversation with a couple of attendees when I heard the commotion coming from the auditorium, but I had no idea that a murder had taken place.

Upon returning to the auditorium, I was met with a scene of chaos. Guests were in shock, and I immediately took charge, trying to calm everyone down and gather information. My experience in managing crowds served me well, but I could see how my sudden appearance in the midst of the turmoil might raise suspicion. I assure you, I had no motive to harm Priest; I was merely fulfilling my responsibilities as the event's guard.

I must also point out that Artist was acting strangely that evening. She had been increasingly frustrated with Priest's popularity, and I couldn't help but notice her lurking around the auditorium before the rehearsal. It seemed odd to me, and I believe you should consider her actions more closely. My focus was solely on ensuring the event went smoothly, and I had no intention of causing harm to anyone.


# Parsed Story for Lawyer

Means: None.
Motive: None.
Opportunity: Lawyer was in the mansion reviewing documents when the murder occurred.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Lawyer was in the mansion, seated at a large oak table cluttered with legal documents. He was reviewing a case that had been troubling him for weeks, one that involved a dispute over property rights that had implications for the resort. His focus was entirely on the papers in front of him, and he was unaware of the events unfolding in the auditorium. The tension between him and Priest had been palpable during their last conversation, but he had no intention of harming her; he simply wanted to resolve the matter professionally.

When the murder occurred, Lawyer remained in the mansion, absorbed in his work. He had no idea that Priest was in danger, as the sounds of the rehearsal had faded into the background. His absence from the auditorium during the critical moment raised eyebrows, as it could be interpreted as an opportunity to commit the crime. However, he was genuinely preoccupied with his legal documents and had no knowledge of the violent act taking place just a short distance away.

After the murder, Lawyer emerged from the mansion, still clutching his papers, only to be met with chaos in the auditorium. Guests were whispering in shock, and the atmosphere was thick with confusion. Lawyer's stoic demeanor made him appear detached, and he quickly became a subject of suspicion among the guests. He attempted to gather information about what had happened, but his serious expression and the legal documents in his hands only added to the perception that he was hiding something.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the mansion before the murder, reviewing some legal documents that required my immediate attention. I had a case that was weighing heavily on my mind, and I was determined to resolve it before the charity event. My focus was entirely on the papers, and I was unaware of what was happening in the auditorium. I had no intention of leaving my work to confront Priest, despite our previous disagreements.

When the murder occurred, I remained in the mansion, completely absorbed in my task. I did not hear any commotion from the auditorium, and I was not in a position to commit the crime. My absence during that critical moment may raise suspicion, but I assure you that I was preoccupied with my legal matters. I had no motive to harm Priest; our disagreements were strictly professional, and I had no personal vendetta against her.

After the murder, I stepped out of the mansion to find the guests in a state of shock. I was startled by the chaos and confusion surrounding the event. I tried to gather information about what had happened, but my serious demeanor and the legal documents I was holding made me appear suspicious. I can assure you that I had no involvement in the murder, and I believe that the focus should be on those who were present in the auditorium at the time.

# Full Prose Prompt

I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

## Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

This is a mystery story in the style of a golden age classic. The story features the following elements:

Victim: Priest (a 27-year-old woman, tall and charming, who speaks in a sarcastic manner)
Killer: Artist (a 22-year-old woman, pale and mean, who speaks in a monotone manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 68-year-old man, blonde and eccentric, who speaks in a formal manner)

Other Characters:
Sailor (a 48-year-old woman, short and absent-minded, who speaks in a verbose manner), Guard (a 69-year-old woman, tall and energetic, who speaks in a articulate manner), Lawyer (a 68-year-old man, tall and stoic, who speaks in a terse manner)

It Takes Place In: Remote island resort
The Crime Happened In: Auditorium
Other Locations in the Story: Mansion, Garden

The Murder Weapon: Candlestick
Other Suspicious Items: Shovel

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Candlestick in the Auditorium by Artist, killing Priest. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In the isolation of a remote island resort, the serene silence is shattered by the brutal murder of a charming young priest, her life snuffed out by a candlestick in the auditorium. The eccentric Detective Detecto must unravel a web of intrigue involving a mean-spirited artist and other unusual suspects, all while battling the island's shadows that seem to hide more secrets than they reveal.

Artist's Story to the Detective: 


I was in my studio, working on my latest piece, when I decided to attend the rehearsal in the auditorium. I had heard that Priest would be there, and I thought it might be a good opportunity to confront her about the way she overshadowed my work. I felt a surge of frustration as I listened to the praise she received from others, and I wanted to express my feelings. I thought perhaps if I could just talk to her, I could make her understand how her presence affected me. It was a simple decision, really, just to go and see her.

When I arrived at the auditorium, it was dark and quiet, with only the sound of Priest rehearsing her speech. I stood in the shadows, watching her, and I felt a mix of emotions. I wanted to tell her how I felt, but the words wouldn’t come. Instead, I picked up the candlestick, which was just sitting there, and I thought about how heavy it felt in my hands. I didn’t intend for anything to happen; I just wanted to express my frustration. But then, in a moment of anger, I struck her. It all happened so fast, and I didn’t really think about what I was doing.

Afterward, I was in shock. I put the candlestick back where it belonged, trying to act as if nothing had happened. I left the auditorium and returned to my studio, where I tried to focus on my paintings. I thought if I could just immerse myself in my work, I could forget about the incident. I didn’t want anyone to suspect me, so I made sure to act normal. I didn’t see anyone else around, and I thought I had gotten away with it. I’m just an artist, trying to create, and I don’t understand why I’m being questioned like this.

Sailor's Story to the Detective: 


As I sit here, I must express my utter shock at the events that have transpired. I was in the garden, you see, tending to my plants, which I find to be a most calming activity. I often lose track of time when I’m with them, and on that fateful evening, I was deep in thought about my memoir. I had been talking to my flowers, sharing my hopes and dreams, completely unaware of the chaos that was unfolding in the auditorium. I assure you, my focus was solely on my gardening, and I had no reason to wish harm upon Priest.

Now, I understand that my absence from the auditorium during the time of the murder may raise questions. However, I must emphasize that I was in the garden, and I did not hear any commotion or cries for help. I was so engrossed in my work that I didn’t even notice the time passing. It’s quite possible that someone else, perhaps the Artist, could have been lurking nearby, given her known jealousy towards Priest. I would never harm anyone, especially not someone as charming as Priest, who I admired from a distance.

I must confess, I did have a shovel in my hands, which I was using for my gardening. I can see how that might look suspicious, but I assure you, it was merely a tool for my plants. I had no intention of using it for anything other than digging. I hope you can understand my innocence in this matter, and I implore you to consider the possibility that someone else, like the Artist, had a motive far more compelling than my own innocent gardening.


Guard's Story to the Detective: 


As I recount the events of that evening, I must emphasize my role as the guard of the event. I was in the auditorium, ensuring everything was prepared for the charity event. I had noticed the tension between Priest and Artist, but I thought it was merely a creative rivalry. I stepped out to check on the guests in the garden, as it was my duty to ensure everyone felt welcomed and attended to. I was engaged in conversation with a couple of attendees when I heard the commotion coming from the auditorium, but I had no idea that a murder had taken place.

Upon returning to the auditorium, I was met with a scene of chaos. Guests were in shock, and I immediately took charge, trying to calm everyone down and gather information. My experience in managing crowds served me well, but I could see how my sudden appearance in the midst of the turmoil might raise suspicion. I assure you, I had no motive to harm Priest; I was merely fulfilling my responsibilities as the event's guard.

I must also point out that Artist was acting strangely that evening. She had been increasingly frustrated with Priest's popularity, and I couldn't help but notice her lurking around the auditorium before the rehearsal. It seemed odd to me, and I believe you should consider her actions more closely. My focus was solely on ensuring the event went smoothly, and I had no intention of causing harm to anyone.


Lawyer's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the mansion before the murder, reviewing some legal documents that required my immediate attention. I had a case that was weighing heavily on my mind, and I was determined to resolve it before the charity event. My focus was entirely on the papers, and I was unaware of what was happening in the auditorium. I had no intention of leaving my work to confront Priest, despite our previous disagreements.

When the murder occurred, I remained in the mansion, completely absorbed in my task. I did not hear any commotion from the auditorium, and I was not in a position to commit the crime. My absence during that critical moment may raise suspicion, but I assure you that I was preoccupied with my legal matters. I had no motive to harm Priest; our disagreements were strictly professional, and I had no personal vendetta against her.

After the murder, I stepped out of the mansion to find the guests in a state of shock. I was startled by the chaos and confusion surrounding the event. I tried to gather information about what had happened, but my serious demeanor and the legal documents I was holding made me appear suspicious. I can assure you that I had no involvement in the murder, and I believe that the focus should be on those who were present in the auditorium at the time.

## Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.
You should use dialog to convey information engage the reader.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point, narrated by Detecto and using dialog where appropriate.

# Full Prose

The remote island resort, usually a haven of tranquility, was now a scene of grim discovery as I, Detective Detecto, arrived at the auditorium where the lifeless body of the young priest lay, a candlestick ominously nearby, stained with the evidence of its deadly use. As I surveyed the scene, the stark reality of the murder was undeniable, and I knew I had to unravel the mystery with the four individuals present: the Guard, the Artist, the Sailor, and the Lawyer.

I began my inquiry with the Artist, who, despite her protests of innocence, seemed to carry a shadow of unease. "I was merely attending the rehearsal," she claimed, her voice monotone, yet I couldn't help but notice her eyes darting towards the candlestick, as if it held a secret only she knew. The Guard, a tall and energetic woman, mentioned, "I noticed the Artist lurking around the auditorium before the rehearsal," her articulate manner leaving little room for doubt about her observations.

As I continued, the Guard's story revealed more than she intended; her sudden absence from the auditorium during the critical moment was a thread I couldn't ignore. "I stepped out to check on the guests in the garden," she explained, but the timing of her departure was suspiciously convenient, and I noted her familiarity with the candlestick's location. The Lawyer, stoic and terse, insisted, "I was in the mansion, absorbed in my documents," yet his tension with the Priest was palpable, a fact he couldn't entirely conceal.

The Sailor, with her verbose manner, recounted, "I was in the garden, tending to my plants," her hands still bearing traces of soil, which she claimed was from her gardening. Her nervousness was evident, and the dirt on her hands seemed to tell a story of its own, though she maintained her innocence. The Artist, meanwhile, mentioned the distant cry of a seagull during the rehearsal, a detail that seemed oddly out of place, yet perhaps significant.

As I pieced together the narratives, the Guard's recollection of the candlestick's untouched position on the table was intriguing, suggesting a deliberate attempt to restore order after chaos. The Lawyer's stoic demeanor, while not incriminating, did little to endear him to the other guests, who eyed him with suspicion. Sailor's humming of a sea shanty, a habit she claimed helped her plants grow, seemed an innocent quirk, yet her nervousness was hard to dismiss.

Each character's story was a puzzle piece, and as I listened, I could sense the truth lurking beneath their words. The Guard's protestations of innocence were earnest, yet her sudden departure from the auditorium was a thread I couldn't ignore. The Lawyer's focus on his documents seemed genuine, yet his previous disagreements with the Priest lingered in my mind. Sailor's innocence was marred by her nervous demeanor, and the Artist's protestations were overshadowed by her earlier tension with the Priest.

As I stood amidst the assembled characters, the weight of the evidence began to coalesce into a coherent picture. I knew the truth was within reach, and with one final revelation, the identity of the murderer would be laid bare.
