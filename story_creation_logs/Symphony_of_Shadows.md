# Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a dagger, an ornate piece that Musician had kept as part of his collection of theatrical props.
Motive: Musician felt overshadowed by Firefighter's bold personality and growing popularity among their peers. He believed that her bluntness and confidence were undermining his own artistic expression and reputation, leading to feelings of jealousy and resentment.
Opportunity: Firefighter was vulnerable when she retreated to the bathroom for a moment of solitude after a heated argument with Musician about a recent performance. This provided Musician with the perfect chance to confront her without anyone else around.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Musician and Firefighter were engaged in a heated discussion in the billiard room, where tensions had been rising over their differing views on creativity and expression. Firefighter, with her blunt demeanor, had dismissed Musician's latest composition as trivial, igniting his frustration. After the argument escalated, Firefighter stormed off, seeking refuge in the bathroom to cool down, while Musician remained in the billiard room, stewing in his emotions and plotting his next move.

In the bathroom, Firefighter was momentarily alone, her thoughts racing as she tried to shake off the confrontation. Unbeknownst to her, Musician had followed her, his demeanor shifting from cheerful to sinister. He entered the bathroom quietly, dagger in hand, and confronted her. In a moment of rage fueled by jealousy, he struck, using the dagger to silence her fiery spirit once and for all.

After the murder, Musician quickly cleaned the dagger and hid it among his theatrical props, ensuring it would not be discovered easily. He then returned to the billiard room, feigning shock when others began to notice Firefighter was missing. He played the part of the concerned friend, all while maintaining a cheerful demeanor, carefully weaving a narrative that would deflect suspicion away from himself.


Story to Detective: 


I assure you, I am completely innocent of any wrongdoing. The night was supposed to be a celebration of creativity, a gathering of minds, and yet, it turned into a tempest of misunderstandings. Firefighter and I had a disagreement, yes, but it was merely a clash of artistic visions. I was merely expressing my thoughts, my passion for music, when she chose to belittle my work. It was a moment of heated exchange, but nothing more. I would never resort to violence over a mere argument; that is not the way of an artist.

After our discussion, I decided to take a moment for myself. I wandered the lodge, admiring the decor, and perhaps even contemplating my next composition. I was in the billiard room, practicing my dramatic gestures, when I realized Firefighter had gone quiet. I thought she might have needed some time alone to reflect on our conversation. I had no idea she was in the bathroom, and I certainly did not follow her there. I was simply lost in my thoughts, trying to channel my emotions into something beautiful.

When the others began to notice her absence, I felt a wave of concern wash over me. I rushed to the bathroom, only to find the door locked. I knocked, calling out to her, but there was no response. Panic set in, and I alerted the others. I was simply a concerned friend, trying to ensure her safety. It’s tragic that she is gone, but I assure you, I had nothing to do with it. My heart aches for her, and I would never harm anyone, especially not a fellow artist.

# Parsed Story for Accountant

Means: Accountant had access to a shovel that was used for gardening outside the lodge.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Accountant was in the office, reviewing financial documents, when the murder occurred.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Accountant was busy in the office, meticulously going over the lodge's financial records. He had been trying to make sense of the budget for the upcoming hunting season, and his eccentric nature had him muttering sarcastic comments to himself about the absurdity of the expenses. He was so engrossed in his work that he hardly noticed the heated argument between Musician and Firefighter in the billiard room, nor did he realize how tense the atmosphere had become.

When the murder occurred, Accountant remained in the office, unaware of the deadly confrontation taking place just a few rooms away. He was flipping through papers and occasionally glancing at the clock, noting how much time had passed since he last saw Firefighter. He had planned to ask her about some discrepancies in the budget, but when he didn’t see her for a while, he assumed she was still cooling off from the argument. His focus on the financial documents kept him from hearing any commotion from the bathroom.

After the murder, Accountant finally decided to leave the office to find Firefighter and discuss the budget. As he stepped into the hallway, he noticed the others gathering and whispering, their expressions tense. He approached the billiard room, where Musician was acting overly concerned, and he felt a chill run down his spine. Accountant’s mind raced as he tried to piece together what had happened, but he was careful to keep his gambling debt a secret, fearing it might make him look suspicious in the eyes of the others.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the office, buried in financial documents when the murder happened. I had no idea anything was going on until I saw everyone gathering in the hallway, looking like they had seen a ghost. I was just trying to make sense of the lodge's budget, which is a nightmare in itself. I mean, who knew hunting could be so expensive? I was too busy with my papers to even hear the argument between Musician and Firefighter. Honestly, I thought they were just having a typical disagreement about creativity or whatever.

When I finally stepped out of the office, I was genuinely concerned about Firefighter. I wanted to ask her about some discrepancies in the budget, but she was nowhere to be found. I thought maybe she was still sulking in the bathroom or something. I didn’t think much of it until I saw the others whispering and looking anxious. It was all very strange, and I felt like I had walked into a scene from a bad play. I mean, who would want to kill a firefighter? It’s not like she was a financial burden on anyone.

Now, if you want to talk about suspicious characters, let’s not overlook Musician. He was acting way too cheerful for someone who just had a fight with Firefighter. I wouldn’t be surprised if he was the one who followed her into the bathroom. I mean, he’s got that dramatic flair, doesn’t he? But me? I was just trying to keep the lodge’s finances in order while dodging my own debts. I assure you, I had no motive to harm Firefighter.


# Parsed Story for Miner

Means: Miner had access to a shovel that was left outside the lodge, which could be misconstrued as a potential weapon.
Motive: Miner felt a strong emotional attachment to Firefighter and was upset by her blunt dismissal of his admiration for her. However, he never wanted her dead; he just wanted her attention.
Opportunity: Miner was in the kitchen preparing snacks for everyone when the murder occurred, making him unaware of the confrontation in the bathroom.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Miner was in the kitchen, nervously preparing snacks for the group. He had always been the one to take on the role of the caretaker, ensuring everyone was fed and comfortable during their stay at the lodge. While he was chopping vegetables, he overheard the argument between Musician and Firefighter from the billiard room. Although he felt a pang of jealousy as he listened to Firefighter's blunt remarks, he chose to stay out of it, believing it was best not to get involved.

When the murder occurred, Miner was still in the kitchen, focused on his task. He was unaware of the tension escalating just a few rooms away. The sounds of the argument faded into the background as he hummed nervously to himself, trying to drown out his thoughts. It wasn't until he finished preparing the snacks and stepped into the hallway that he noticed the unusual quietness and the gathering of the others, their expressions tense and worried.

After the murder, Miner felt a wave of panic wash over him. He joined the group in the billiard room, where Musician was feigning concern. Miner’s nervousness made him fidgety, and he found himself glancing around, trying to gauge the reactions of the others. When Detective Detecto arrived, he felt a knot tighten in his stomach, fearing that his innocent actions might be misinterpreted as suspicious. He desperately wanted to defend himself and explain that he had no part in the tragedy that had unfolded.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the kitchen preparing snacks for everyone when the argument started. I heard Musician and Firefighter going at it, and I felt a bit nervous. I had a crush on Firefighter, but I never wanted to get involved in their fight. I thought it was best to stay out of it, so I just kept chopping vegetables and trying to focus on making sure everyone had something to eat. I didn’t want to interrupt their discussion, even though I felt a pang of jealousy when I heard Firefighter dismissing Musician's work.

When I finished in the kitchen, I stepped into the hallway and noticed how quiet it had become. I thought it was odd that Firefighter hadn’t come back yet, but I assumed she was still cooling off. I joined the others in the billiard room, where I saw Musician acting overly concerned. I felt a knot in my stomach, and I could see the tension in everyone’s faces. I was just trying to figure out what was going on, but I didn’t know anything about the murder until I saw everyone gathering and whispering.

I swear I had no idea anything was wrong until I saw the panic on everyone’s faces. I was just trying to help out by making snacks, and I didn’t even hear anything suspicious while I was in the kitchen. I know it looks bad that I was outside with the shovel earlier, but I was just cleaning up the yard. I didn’t have any motive to hurt Firefighter; I liked her too much for that. I just want to clear my name and find out who really did this.


# Parsed Story for Chauffeur

Means: The hidden hunting knives could be seen as a potential weapon.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Chauffeur was alone in the garage when the murder occurred, making her absence from the main lodge suspicious.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Chauffeur was busy in the garage, meticulously cleaning the lodge's vehicles. She had a routine of ensuring everything was in top shape for the hunting season, and today was no different. While scrubbing the exterior of a large SUV, she stumbled upon a hidden compartment in the trunk that contained old hunting knives. She was intrigued but also a bit unnerved by the discovery, as they seemed out of place and potentially dangerous.

When the murder occurred, Chauffeur was still in the garage, focused on her task. She was unaware of the heated argument between Musician and Firefighter in the billiard room, as the sounds of her scrubbing drowned out any noise from the main lodge. The garage was isolated, and she had no idea that Firefighter was being attacked just a few rooms away. Her meticulous nature kept her absorbed in her work, and she didn’t notice the time passing.

After the murder, Chauffeur finally finished cleaning the vehicles and decided to head back into the lodge. As she entered, she noticed a gathering of the others in the hallway, their expressions tense and worried. Confused, she approached the group, only to find them whispering about Firefighter’s absence. Chauffeur felt a wave of anxiety wash over her, knowing that her solitary actions in the garage might make her seem suspicious, especially since she had been out of sight when the murder took place.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the garage, cleaning the vehicles, as I always do. I take pride in my work, and I wanted everything to be perfect for the hunting season. While I was scrubbing the SUV, I found some old hunting knives hidden in the trunk. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but it made me uneasy. I was just trying to focus on my task and not get distracted by anything else happening in the lodge.

When the murder happened, I was completely unaware. The sounds of my cleaning drowned out everything else. I was so absorbed in my work that I didn’t even notice how much time had passed. I thought everyone was still in the billiard room, and I didn’t hear any commotion. I was just trying to do my job, and I didn’t think anything was wrong until I stepped back into the lodge and saw everyone gathered, looking worried.

I know it looks suspicious that I was alone in the garage, but I swear I had nothing to do with it. I was just cleaning, and I didn’t see anyone else. You should really talk to Musician; he was the one arguing with Firefighter. I didn’t hear any of that, but I know he was upset. I just want to clear my name and make sure you understand I had no part in this terrible tragedy.

# Full Prose Prompt

I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

## Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

This is a mystery story in the style of a golden age classic. The story features the following elements:

Victim: Firefighter (a 22-year-old woman, curly-haired and mean, who speaks in a blunt manner)
Killer: Musician (a 42-year-old man, lanky and cheerful, who speaks in a dramatic manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 29-year-old woman, freckled and meticulous, who speaks in a terse manner)

Other Characters:
Accountant (a 45-year-old man, redhead and eccentric, who speaks in a sarcastic manner), Miner (a 23-year-old man, fat and nervous, who speaks in a articulate manner), Chauffeur (a 51-year-old woman, lanky and meticulous, who speaks in a mumbling manner)

It Takes Place In: Secluded hunting lodge
The Crime Happened In: Bathroom
Other Locations in the Story: Billiard Room, Office

The Murder Weapon: Dagger
Other Suspicious Items: Shovel

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Dagger in the Bathroom by Musician, killing Firefighter. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In the secluded hunting lodge, a jovial musician orchestrates a deadly tune with a dagger, extinguishing the fiery spirit of a young firefighter. Now, it's up to the meticulous Detective Detecto to decipher the clues within the lodge's billiard room and office, uncover the secrets of a suspicious shovel, and bring the killer to justice before the final note of this deadly symphony is played.

Musician's Story to the Detective: 


I assure you, I am completely innocent of any wrongdoing. The night was supposed to be a celebration of creativity, a gathering of minds, and yet, it turned into a tempest of misunderstandings. Firefighter and I had a disagreement, yes, but it was merely a clash of artistic visions. I was merely expressing my thoughts, my passion for music, when she chose to belittle my work. It was a moment of heated exchange, but nothing more. I would never resort to violence over a mere argument; that is not the way of an artist.

After our discussion, I decided to take a moment for myself. I wandered the lodge, admiring the decor, and perhaps even contemplating my next composition. I was in the billiard room, practicing my dramatic gestures, when I realized Firefighter had gone quiet. I thought she might have needed some time alone to reflect on our conversation. I had no idea she was in the bathroom, and I certainly did not follow her there. I was simply lost in my thoughts, trying to channel my emotions into something beautiful.

When the others began to notice her absence, I felt a wave of concern wash over me. I rushed to the bathroom, only to find the door locked. I knocked, calling out to her, but there was no response. Panic set in, and I alerted the others. I was simply a concerned friend, trying to ensure her safety. It’s tragic that she is gone, but I assure you, I had nothing to do with it. My heart aches for her, and I would never harm anyone, especially not a fellow artist.

Accountant's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the office, buried in financial documents when the murder happened. I had no idea anything was going on until I saw everyone gathering in the hallway, looking like they had seen a ghost. I was just trying to make sense of the lodge's budget, which is a nightmare in itself. I mean, who knew hunting could be so expensive? I was too busy with my papers to even hear the argument between Musician and Firefighter. Honestly, I thought they were just having a typical disagreement about creativity or whatever.

When I finally stepped out of the office, I was genuinely concerned about Firefighter. I wanted to ask her about some discrepancies in the budget, but she was nowhere to be found. I thought maybe she was still sulking in the bathroom or something. I didn’t think much of it until I saw the others whispering and looking anxious. It was all very strange, and I felt like I had walked into a scene from a bad play. I mean, who would want to kill a firefighter? It’s not like she was a financial burden on anyone.

Now, if you want to talk about suspicious characters, let’s not overlook Musician. He was acting way too cheerful for someone who just had a fight with Firefighter. I wouldn’t be surprised if he was the one who followed her into the bathroom. I mean, he’s got that dramatic flair, doesn’t he? But me? I was just trying to keep the lodge’s finances in order while dodging my own debts. I assure you, I had no motive to harm Firefighter.


Miner's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the kitchen preparing snacks for everyone when the argument started. I heard Musician and Firefighter going at it, and I felt a bit nervous. I had a crush on Firefighter, but I never wanted to get involved in their fight. I thought it was best to stay out of it, so I just kept chopping vegetables and trying to focus on making sure everyone had something to eat. I didn’t want to interrupt their discussion, even though I felt a pang of jealousy when I heard Firefighter dismissing Musician's work.

When I finished in the kitchen, I stepped into the hallway and noticed how quiet it had become. I thought it was odd that Firefighter hadn’t come back yet, but I assumed she was still cooling off. I joined the others in the billiard room, where I saw Musician acting overly concerned. I felt a knot in my stomach, and I could see the tension in everyone’s faces. I was just trying to figure out what was going on, but I didn’t know anything about the murder until I saw everyone gathering and whispering.

I swear I had no idea anything was wrong until I saw the panic on everyone’s faces. I was just trying to help out by making snacks, and I didn’t even hear anything suspicious while I was in the kitchen. I know it looks bad that I was outside with the shovel earlier, but I was just cleaning up the yard. I didn’t have any motive to hurt Firefighter; I liked her too much for that. I just want to clear my name and find out who really did this.


Chauffeur's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the garage, cleaning the vehicles, as I always do. I take pride in my work, and I wanted everything to be perfect for the hunting season. While I was scrubbing the SUV, I found some old hunting knives hidden in the trunk. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but it made me uneasy. I was just trying to focus on my task and not get distracted by anything else happening in the lodge.

When the murder happened, I was completely unaware. The sounds of my cleaning drowned out everything else. I was so absorbed in my work that I didn’t even notice how much time had passed. I thought everyone was still in the billiard room, and I didn’t hear any commotion. I was just trying to do my job, and I didn’t think anything was wrong until I stepped back into the lodge and saw everyone gathered, looking worried.

I know it looks suspicious that I was alone in the garage, but I swear I had nothing to do with it. I was just cleaning, and I didn’t see anyone else. You should really talk to Musician; he was the one arguing with Firefighter. I didn’t hear any of that, but I know he was upset. I just want to clear my name and make sure you understand I had no part in this terrible tragedy.

## Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.
You should use dialog to convey information engage the reader.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point, narrated by Detecto and using dialog where appropriate.

# Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the secluded hunting lodge, her freckled face set in a determined expression as she surveyed the grim scene before her. The victim, a young firefighter, lay lifeless on the bathroom floor, a dagger protruding from her chest, blood pooling around her. Only four people were present at the lodge: the Miner, the Musician, the Accountant, and the Chauffeur, and Detecto knew that one of them must be the killer.

Detecto began her investigation by speaking with the Accountant, who insisted, "I was in the office, buried in financial documents when the murder happened. I had no motive to harm Firefighter." Despite his protests, Detecto noticed a faint trace of dirt under his fingernails, suggesting recent use of a shovel, which was later found outside the lodge.

Turning to the Chauffeur, Detecto listened as she explained, "I was in the garage, cleaning the vehicles. I often hum my favorite tunes while working, and today I was particularly fond of an old classic." Detecto noted the Chauffeur's unease as she mentioned, "I know it looks suspicious that I was alone in the garage," and observed her glancing nervously at the hunting knives she had discovered in the SUV trunk.

The Miner, when questioned, recounted, "I was in the kitchen preparing snacks for everyone when the murder occurred. I swear I had no idea anything was wrong until I saw the panic on everyone’s faces." Detecto observed the Miner's flushed cheeks and the way he avoided eye contact when mentioning his fondness for Firefighter, hinting at an emotional attachment that he tried to downplay.

Finally, Detecto approached the Musician, who protested, "I assure you, I am completely innocent. Firefighter and I had a disagreement, but it was nothing more than a clash of artistic visions." Detecto's keen eye caught the slight tremor in his hands and the way he avoided looking at the ornate dagger, which matched the description of one from his collection of theatrical props.

As Detecto pieced together the stories, she noted the Accountant's careful avoidance of discussing his gambling debts, the Chauffeur's anxiety about her solitary actions, and the Miner's nervousness about his feelings for Firefighter. The Musician's dramatic flair and the argument with Firefighter provided a motive, but Detecto refrained from drawing conclusions just yet.

Detecto's meticulous nature led her to examine the lodge's walls, adorned with hunting trophies, and the motivational poster in the office that read 'Success is a Journey,' which seemed to mock the Accountant's financial struggles. As she gathered the suspects in the billiard room, Detecto knew she had unraveled the tangled web of lies and deceit. With all the evidence laid out before her, Detecto was ready to reveal the truth, confident in her deduction of who the murderer was.
