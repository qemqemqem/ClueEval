# Murder on the Grand Liner

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the scene of the crime aboard the luxurious ocean liner, his booming voice echoing through the library as he surveyed the grim sight of the Cook's lifeless body sprawled on the floor, a knife protruding from her chest, blood pooling beneath her. The library was eerily silent, save for the hushed whispers of the four individuals present: the Chauffeur, Waiter, Maid, and Shopkeeper, each casting furtive glances at one another. Detecto, tall and imposing despite his stutter, began his investigation, his keen eyes missing nothing as he questioned the suspects.

The Chauffeur, a muscular man with an elegant demeanor, insisted on his innocence, claiming he had been in the lounge, engaged in lively conversation with guests, and thus had no opportunity to attack Cook. Detecto noted the Chauffeur's access to the kitchen knives, given his role in transporting supplies, a detail the man seemed eager to downplay. As the Chauffeur spoke, Detecto observed his nervous laughter and frequent jokes about forgetting cocktail names, a possible attempt to deflect suspicion.

The Maid, cheerful yet sarcastic, protested her innocence, explaining she had been serving drinks in the lounge when the murder occurred, though Detecto's intuition told him there was more to her story. Her previous presence in the library, preparing for a gathering, was a fact she conveniently omitted, yet her access to the kitchen knives was undeniable. A peculiar discussion in the lounge about a guest's fascination with collecting miniature spoons caught Detecto's attention, a seemingly trivial detail that might hold significance.

The Shopkeeper, absent-minded and terse, mingled with guests in the lounge, feigning interest in their conversations while Detecto's instincts told him the man was hiding something. Detecto deduced that the secluded library, where Cook had been preparing a list of ingredients for the gala, provided the perfect opportunity for the Shopkeeper to confront her without drawing attention. The Shopkeeper's protestations of innocence were overshadowed by the detective's awareness of a long-standing rivalry over a lucrative catering contract, a motive that simmered beneath the surface.

The Waiter, confident yet mumbling, assured Detecto of their innocence, recounting their duties in the lounge and their shock upon discovering Cook's body. Detecto noted the Waiter's access to the knife used in the murder, a fact they seemed eager to gloss over, and their presence in the lounge during the crime, which they emphasized repeatedly. The vibrant flowers arranged by the Waiter the day before seemed an odd detail to mention, yet Detecto filed it away for later consideration.

As Detecto pieced together the testimonies, he noted the Maid's hurried demeanor as she rushed past the library door, a detail corroborated by the Waiter's observation. The Chauffeur's feigned shock and concern upon discovering Cook's body struck Detecto as overly theatrical, while the absence of his fingerprints on the murder weapon was a curious anomaly. The Maid's lingering unease about her previous presence in the library did not escape Detecto's notice, nor did the Shopkeeper's calculated small talk with the Waiter and Chauffeur, his eyes never straying far from the library door.

The Waiter's mention of a guest complaining about the lounge's temperature seemed inconsequential, yet Detecto knew that even the smallest detail could unravel the truth. The library's peculiar smell of old books mingled with fresh lavender, as described by the Shopkeeper, added another layer to the mystery. With each revelation, Detecto's mind whirred with possibilities, his deductions leading him inexorably toward the truth. It must be one of these suspects, and Detecto knew just who it was.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Cook?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Shopkeeper
- B: Maid
- C: Waiter
- D: Chauffeur

## Correct Answer

The killer is Shopkeeper

## Reasoning

- [AFTER_CRIME]	The detective finds that the knife used in the murder has no fingerprints from Chauffeur, indicating he did not handle it. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Chauffeur)
- [DURING_CRIME]	I had been busy serving drinks in the lounge when the murder took place. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Maid)
- [BEFORE_CRIME]	I was busy serving guests in the lounge before the murder occurred. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Waiter)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Shopkeeper wanted Cook dead due to a long-standing rivalry over a lucrative catering contract that Cook had secured for the ocean liner's upcoming gala. The contract had been a source of tension between them, as Shopkeeper believed he was more qualified and had been unfairly overlooked. This resentment festered into a desire for revenge, especially after Cook publicly humiliated him during a disagreement about menu choices. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Shopkeeper)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a knife from the kitchen, which Shopkeeper had access to due to his frequent visits to the galley for supplies. The knife was sharp and well-suited for the crime, allowing for a swift and lethal attack. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Shopkeeper)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Cook was vulnerable to attack when she was alone in the library, preparing a list of ingredients for the gala. The library was secluded, and at that time, most of the crew and guests were occupied in the lounge or ballroom, making it the perfect moment for Shopkeeper to confront her without drawing attention. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Shopkeeper)

### Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a knife from the kitchen, which Shopkeeper had access to due to his frequent visits to the galley for supplies. The knife was sharp and well-suited for the crime, allowing for a swift and lethal attack.
Motive: Shopkeeper wanted Cook dead due to a long-standing rivalry over a lucrative catering contract that Cook had secured for the ocean liner's upcoming gala. The contract had been a source of tension between them, as Shopkeeper believed he was more qualified and had been unfairly overlooked. This resentment festered into a desire for revenge, especially after Cook publicly humiliated him during a disagreement about menu choices.
Opportunity: Cook was vulnerable to attack when she was alone in the library, preparing a list of ingredients for the gala. The library was secluded, and at that time, most of the crew and guests were occupied in the lounge or ballroom, making it the perfect moment for Shopkeeper to confront her without drawing attention.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Shopkeeper had been in the lounge, mingling with guests and pretending to be engrossed in conversation. However, he was keenly aware of Cook's routine and knew she would be alone in the library, as she often retreated there to work on her menus away from prying eyes. After a brief chat with the Maid, who was busy serving drinks, Shopkeeper excused himself and made his way to the library, feigning a need to discuss a supply issue with Cook.

Once in the library, Shopkeeper found Cook engrossed in her notes, her back turned to him. He approached her quietly, and in a moment of rage fueled by jealousy and resentment, he drew the knife from his pocket and plunged it into her back. The act was swift, and Cook had no time to react or defend herself. After ensuring she was lifeless, he quickly wiped the knife clean and returned it to the kitchen, hoping to erase any trace of his involvement.

After the murder, Shopkeeper returned to the lounge, maintaining his absent-minded demeanor. He engaged in small talk with the Waiter and Chauffeur, all the while keeping an eye on the library door. When the commotion began as others discovered Cook's body, he feigned shock and concern, blending in with the crowd while inwardly reveling in the success of his plan. He believed he had outsmarted everyone, convinced that his unassuming nature would shield him from suspicion.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the lounge, enjoying the festivities and chatting with the guests when I heard a commotion coming from the library. I had no idea what was happening at that moment. I often visit the galley for supplies, and I had just been discussing some menu items with the Maid. I remember feeling a bit flustered, as I had been trying to keep up with the demands of the guests. I thought it best to check on Cook, as she was always so focused on her work. I had no intention of causing any trouble.

When I entered the library, Cook was busy with her notes, and I simply wanted to ask her about some ingredients for the gala. I approached her, but she seemed so absorbed in her work that she barely acknowledged me. I must have startled her when I came too close, but I assure you, I was just trying to help. I didn’t see anything unusual or alarming; it was just a normal conversation about food. I left the library shortly after, feeling a bit awkward about interrupting her.

I was shocked when I heard the news of her death. I can’t believe something so terrible could happen on this ship. I was in the lounge the entire time, surrounded by guests. I would never harm Cook; we had our disagreements, but who doesn’t? I’m just a simple shopkeeper trying to make a living. I had no motive to hurt her, and I certainly didn’t see anything suspicious that day. I’m just as bewildered as everyone else about this tragedy.

### Parsed Story for Chauffeur

Means: Chauffeur has access to the kitchen knives, including the murder weapon, as he often helps transport supplies.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Chauffeur was in the lounge, where he could see the library door, but he was engaged in conversation with guests and did not have the opportunity to attack Cook.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Chauffeur was busy attending to his duties in the lounge, where he mingled with guests and ensured their comfort. He moved gracefully among the crowd, serving drinks and engaging in rapid-fire conversations, all the while casting glances toward the library. He had noticed Cook retreating there earlier, and although he felt a pang of longing, he respected her need for solitude and focused on his tasks.

When the murder occurred, Chauffeur was still in the lounge, animatedly discussing the latest trends in luxury travel with a group of guests. He was unaware of the events unfolding in the library, as the noise of laughter and clinking glasses drowned out any sounds from that part of the ship. His attention was fully on the conversation, and he had no reason to suspect that anything was amiss until the commotion erupted, signaling that something terrible had happened.

After the discovery of Cook's body, Chauffeur's demeanor shifted from jovial to alarmed. He rushed toward the library, his heart racing as he pushed through the crowd that had gathered. He feigned shock and concern, but inside, he was grappling with his feelings of helplessness and grief. As he stood among the onlookers, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, and he felt the weight of suspicion hanging over him, despite his innocence.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been in the lounge before the murder, engaging with guests and ensuring they were well taken care of. I was completely focused on my duties and had no idea that anything was happening in the library. I even mentioned that I had seen Cook earlier, but I respected her need for privacy and didn't want to intrude on her work. 

When the commotion started, I was one of the first to rush to the library, genuinely shocked to find Cook's lifeless body. I expressed my concern to the others gathered there, trying to process the horror of the situation. I felt a sense of panic as I realized that my presence in the lounge could be misconstrued, especially since I had access to the kitchen knives, including the one used in the murder.

I also pointed out that the Shopkeeper had been acting strangely, and I couldn't help but notice how he seemed to blend in with the crowd after the murder. I suggested that his absent-minded demeanor might be a cover for something more sinister. I wanted to make it clear that I had no motive to harm Cook; I admired her and would never dream of hurting her. 


### Parsed Story for Maid

Means: Maid has access to the kitchen knives, including the murder weapon.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Maid was in the lounge serving drinks when the murder occurred, but she had previously been in the library preparing for a gathering.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Maid was bustling about the luxurious ocean liner, serving drinks and chatting with guests in the lounge. She was cheerful and sarcastic, making light of the guests' requests while keeping an eye on the clock. Earlier, she had briefly entered the library to gather some supplies for the evening's gathering, where she noticed Cook engrossed in her notes. Although she felt a pang of concern for Cook's solitude, she left the library to continue her duties, believing Cook preferred to be alone.

When the murder occurred, Maid was still in the lounge, engaged in a lively conversation with a group of guests. The atmosphere was filled with laughter and clinking glasses, drowning out any sounds from the library. Maid was completely unaware of the grim events unfolding just a few doors away, as she focused on her tasks and maintained her cheerful demeanor. It wasn't until the commotion erupted that she realized something was terribly wrong.

After the discovery of Cook's body, Maid's cheerful facade began to crack. She rushed toward the library, her heart racing as she pushed through the crowd. Once inside, she feigned shock and concern, but her mind was racing with thoughts of the Chauffeur and how he might react to the news. As she stood among the onlookers, she couldn't shake the feeling that her previous presence in the library might raise suspicions, especially since she had been there just before the murder.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been busy serving drinks in the lounge when the murder took place. I had briefly entered the library earlier to gather supplies and noticed Cook working on her menus, but I left her there, thinking she preferred her solitude. I was completely focused on my duties and engaged in conversation with the guests, so I had no idea anything was amiss until the commotion broke out. I was shocked to hear about Cook's death, and I rushed to the library out of concern.

I also mentioned that I had seen the Shopkeeper earlier in the lounge, mingling with guests and appearing quite absent-minded. I found it odd that he had approached Cook in the library, as he seemed more interested in his own conversations. I couldn't help but think that his demeanor was suspicious, especially given the circumstances. It was hard to believe that someone so seemingly oblivious could be involved in such a heinous act.

I tried to assure the detective that I had no motive to harm Cook. My only concern was for the well-being of everyone on board, especially the Chauffeur, whom I had developed feelings for. I knew that my presence in the library might raise questions, but I was merely doing my job. I hoped that my cheerful nature and dedication to my work would help clear my name in this dreadful situation.


### Parsed Story for Waiter

Means: Waiter had access to the knife used in the murder, as they worked in the dining area where the kitchen supplies were kept.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Waiter was in the lounge, serving drinks and attending to guests, when the murder occurred, making them unaware of Cook's vulnerability.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Waiter was bustling about the lounge, serving drinks and engaging in light banter with the guests. They were confident and jovial, moving from table to table, ensuring everyone was satisfied with their service. However, in the midst of their duties, Waiter had overheard a tense conversation between Cook and Shopkeeper earlier in the day, where Cook had expressed concerns about the quality of supplies Shopkeeper had been providing. This knowledge weighed on Waiter’s mind, but they felt it was not their place to intervene.

When the murder occurred, Waiter was still in the lounge, attending to a particularly demanding group of guests who were clamoring for more champagne. The noise of laughter and conversation drowned out any sounds from the library, and Waiter remained oblivious to the grim events unfolding just a few doors away. They were focused on their tasks, but their attention was drawn to the library door when they noticed the Maid rushing past, her expression suddenly serious.

After the discovery of Cook's body, Waiter felt a wave of panic wash over them. They quickly moved toward the library, blending in with the crowd that had gathered. As they stood among the onlookers, they feigned shock and concern, but internally, they were grappling with the implications of what they had overheard. They worried that their knowledge of the earlier conversation might make them seem suspicious, especially if anyone connected the dots between Shopkeeper and Cook's concerns.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was busy serving guests in the lounge before the murder occurred. I was completely focused on my duties, ensuring that everyone had their drinks and was enjoying themselves. I had no idea that anything was happening in the library until the commotion erupted, and I rushed to see what was wrong. I was shocked to find Cook's body, and I assure you, I had no motive to harm her. 

I mentioned that I had overheard a conversation between Cook and Shopkeeper earlier in the day, where Cook expressed her concerns about the supplies. I thought it was just a business matter and didn’t think much of it at the time. I didn’t want to get involved in their issues, but now I realize that it might look suspicious. I was just doing my job, and I had no reason to want Cook dead. 

I also pointed out that I had access to the knife used in the murder, but it was part of my duties to handle kitchen supplies. I was in the lounge the entire time, and I couldn’t have committed the murder without anyone noticing. I hope you can see that I am innocent, and I truly believe that Shopkeeper might have had something to do with this, given their earlier conversation with Cook.

It Takes Place In: Luxurious ocean liner
The Crime Happened In: Library
Other Locations in the Story: Lounge, Ballroom

The Murder Weapon: Knife
Other Suspicious Items: Poison

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Knife in the Library by Shopkeeper, killing Cook. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: Aboard the luxurious ocean liner, a gruesome crime unfolds as the stoic cook is found dead in the library, with the shopkeeper as the prime suspect. As the seemingly absent-minded killer eludes suspicion, the stuttering yet astute Detective Detecto navigates a web of deceit, poison, and hidden agendas to reveal the shocking truth.

Shopkeeper's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the lounge, enjoying the festivities and chatting with the guests when I heard a commotion coming from the library. I had no idea what was happening at that moment. I often visit the galley for supplies, and I had just been discussing some menu items with the Maid. I remember feeling a bit flustered, as I had been trying to keep up with the demands of the guests. I thought it best to check on Cook, as she was always so focused on her work. I had no intention of causing any trouble.

When I entered the library, Cook was busy with her notes, and I simply wanted to ask her about some ingredients for the gala. I approached her, but she seemed so absorbed in her work that she barely acknowledged me. I must have startled her when I came too close, but I assure you, I was just trying to help. I didn’t see anything unusual or alarming; it was just a normal conversation about food. I left the library shortly after, feeling a bit awkward about interrupting her.

I was shocked when I heard the news of her death. I can’t believe something so terrible could happen on this ship. I was in the lounge the entire time, surrounded by guests. I would never harm Cook; we had our disagreements, but who doesn’t? I’m just a simple shopkeeper trying to make a living. I had no motive to hurt her, and I certainly didn’t see anything suspicious that day. I’m just as bewildered as everyone else about this tragedy.

Chauffeur's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been in the lounge before the murder, engaging with guests and ensuring they were well taken care of. I was completely focused on my duties and had no idea that anything was happening in the library. I even mentioned that I had seen Cook earlier, but I respected her need for privacy and didn't want to intrude on her work. 

When the commotion started, I was one of the first to rush to the library, genuinely shocked to find Cook's lifeless body. I expressed my concern to the others gathered there, trying to process the horror of the situation. I felt a sense of panic as I realized that my presence in the lounge could be misconstrued, especially since I had access to the kitchen knives, including the one used in the murder.

I also pointed out that the Shopkeeper had been acting strangely, and I couldn't help but notice how he seemed to blend in with the crowd after the murder. I suggested that his absent-minded demeanor might be a cover for something more sinister. I wanted to make it clear that I had no motive to harm Cook; I admired her and would never dream of hurting her. 


Maid's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been busy serving drinks in the lounge when the murder took place. I had briefly entered the library earlier to gather supplies and noticed Cook working on her menus, but I left her there, thinking she preferred her solitude. I was completely focused on my duties and engaged in conversation with the guests, so I had no idea anything was amiss until the commotion broke out. I was shocked to hear about Cook's death, and I rushed to the library out of concern.

I also mentioned that I had seen the Shopkeeper earlier in the lounge, mingling with guests and appearing quite absent-minded. I found it odd that he had approached Cook in the library, as he seemed more interested in his own conversations. I couldn't help but think that his demeanor was suspicious, especially given the circumstances. It was hard to believe that someone so seemingly oblivious could be involved in such a heinous act.

I tried to assure the detective that I had no motive to harm Cook. My only concern was for the well-being of everyone on board, especially the Chauffeur, whom I had developed feelings for. I knew that my presence in the library might raise questions, but I was merely doing my job. I hoped that my cheerful nature and dedication to my work would help clear my name in this dreadful situation.


Waiter's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was busy serving guests in the lounge before the murder occurred. I was completely focused on my duties, ensuring that everyone had their drinks and was enjoying themselves. I had no idea that anything was happening in the library until the commotion erupted, and I rushed to see what was wrong. I was shocked to find Cook's body, and I assure you, I had no motive to harm her. 

I mentioned that I had overheard a conversation between Cook and Shopkeeper earlier in the day, where Cook expressed her concerns about the supplies. I thought it was just a business matter and didn’t think much of it at the time. I didn’t want to get involved in their issues, but now I realize that it might look suspicious. I was just doing my job, and I had no reason to want Cook dead. 

I also pointed out that I had access to the knife used in the murder, but it was part of my duties to handle kitchen supplies. I was in the lounge the entire time, and I couldn’t have committed the murder without anyone noticing. I hope you can see that I am innocent, and I truly believe that Shopkeeper might have had something to do with this, given their earlier conversation with Cook.

# Outline

Now, here's the outline of the story that I have. I want you to follow this outline strictly, but I want you to convert it into prose.

- Narrator:	The setting: Luxurious ocean liner. The victim, Cook, lies dead on the floor in the Library! They were clearly murdered with Knife (describe blood, etc).
- Narrator:	Detective Detecto arrives at the scene of the crime. (Detecto is a 62-year-old man, tall and stuttering, who speaks in a booming manner)
- Narrator:	There are only 4 people present: Chauffeur, Waiter, Maid, Shopkeeper. No one else could possibly have been here.
- Narrator:	The detective begins to poke around and ask questions. And this is what the detective learns, from clues and from talking to the people present:
- Chauffeur (concealed from detective):	Chauffeur was in the lounge, where he could see the library door, but he was engaged in conversation with guests and did not have the opportunity to attack Cook.
- Chauffeur (concealed from detective):	Chauffeur has access to the kitchen knives, including the murder weapon, as he often helps transport supplies.
- Chauffeur:	Chauffeur protests that they are innocent.
- Chauffeur (concealed from detective):	Chauffeur has access to the kitchen knives, including the murder weapon, as he often helps transport supplies.
- Chauffeur (concealed from detective):	Chauffeur was in the lounge, where he could see the library door, but he was engaged in conversation with guests and did not have the opportunity to attack Cook.
- Chauffeur:	During his conversations, Chauffeur often joked about how he could never remember the names of the fancy cocktails he served.
- Maid (concealed from detective):	Maid was in the lounge serving drinks when the murder occurred, but she had previously been in the library preparing for a gathering.
- Maid:	Maid protests that they are innocent.
- Maid (concealed from detective):	Maid has access to the kitchen knives, including the murder weapon.
- Maid (concealed from detective):	Maid was in the lounge serving drinks when the murder occurred, but she had previously been in the library preparing for a gathering.
- Maid:	One of the guests had a peculiar fascination with collecting miniature spoons, which sparked a lively discussion in the lounge.
- Shopkeeper:	Shopkeeper mingled with guests in the lounge, pretending to be engrossed in conversation.
- Shopkeeper (concealed from detective):	Cook was vulnerable to attack when she was alone in the library, preparing a list of ingredients for the gala. The library was secluded, and at that time, most of the crew and guests were occupied in the lounge or ballroom, making it the perfect moment for Shopkeeper to confront her without drawing attention.
- Shopkeeper:	Shopkeeper protests that they are innocent.
- Shopkeeper (concealed from detective):	Shopkeeper wanted Cook dead due to a long-standing rivalry over a lucrative catering contract that Cook had secured for the ocean liner's upcoming gala. The contract had been a source of tension between them, as Shopkeeper believed he was more qualified and had been unfairly overlooked. This resentment festered into a desire for revenge, especially after Cook publicly humiliated him during a disagreement about menu choices.
- Shopkeeper (concealed from detective):	The murder was committed using a knife from the kitchen, which Shopkeeper had access to due to his frequent visits to the galley for supplies. The knife was sharp and well-suited for the crime, allowing for a swift and lethal attack.

# Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point.

### Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the scene of the crime aboard the luxurious ocean liner, his booming voice echoing through the library as he surveyed the grim sight of the Cook's lifeless body sprawled on the floor, a knife protruding from her chest, blood pooling beneath her. The library was eerily silent, save for the hushed whispers of the four individuals present: the Chauffeur, Waiter, Maid, and Shopkeeper, each casting furtive glances at one another. Detecto, tall and imposing despite his stutter, began his investigation, his keen eyes missing nothing as he questioned the suspects.

The Chauffeur, a muscular man with an elegant demeanor, insisted on his innocence, claiming he had been in the lounge, engaged in lively conversation with guests, and thus had no opportunity to attack Cook. Detecto noted the Chauffeur's access to the kitchen knives, given his role in transporting supplies, a detail the man seemed eager to downplay. As the Chauffeur spoke, Detecto observed his nervous laughter and frequent jokes about forgetting cocktail names, a possible attempt to deflect suspicion.

The Maid, cheerful yet sarcastic, protested her innocence, explaining she had been serving drinks in the lounge when the murder occurred, though Detecto's intuition told him there was more to her story. Her previous presence in the library, preparing for a gathering, was a fact she conveniently omitted, yet her access to the kitchen knives was undeniable. A peculiar discussion in the lounge about a guest's fascination with collecting miniature spoons caught Detecto's attention, a seemingly trivial detail that might hold significance.

The Shopkeeper, absent-minded and terse, mingled with guests in the lounge, feigning interest in their conversations while Detecto's instincts told him the man was hiding something. Detecto deduced that the secluded library, where Cook had been preparing a list of ingredients for the gala, provided the perfect opportunity for the Shopkeeper to confront her without drawing attention. The Shopkeeper's protestations of innocence were overshadowed by the detective's awareness of a long-standing rivalry over a lucrative catering contract, a motive that simmered beneath the surface.

The Waiter, confident yet mumbling, assured Detecto of their innocence, recounting their duties in the lounge and their shock upon discovering Cook's body. Detecto noted the Waiter's access to the knife used in the murder, a fact they seemed eager to gloss over, and their presence in the lounge during the crime, which they emphasized repeatedly. The vibrant flowers arranged by the Waiter the day before seemed an odd detail to mention, yet Detecto filed it away for later consideration.

As Detecto pieced together the testimonies, he noted the Maid's hurried demeanor as she rushed past the library door, a detail corroborated by the Waiter's observation. The Chauffeur's feigned shock and concern upon discovering Cook's body struck Detecto as overly theatrical, while the absence of his fingerprints on the murder weapon was a curious anomaly. The Maid's lingering unease about her previous presence in the library did not escape Detecto's notice, nor did the Shopkeeper's calculated small talk with the Waiter and Chauffeur, his eyes never straying far from the library door.

The Waiter's mention of a guest complaining about the lounge's temperature seemed inconsequential, yet Detecto knew that even the smallest detail could unravel the truth. The library's peculiar smell of old books mingled with fresh lavender, as described by the Shopkeeper, added another layer to the mystery. With each revelation, Detecto's mind whirred with possibilities, his deductions leading him inexorably toward the truth. It must be one of these suspects, and Detecto knew just who it was.
