# The Island Auditorium Murders

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the private island estate, his pale complexion contrasting sharply with the vibrant surroundings, as he stepped into the auditorium where the lifeless body of the Policeman lay sprawled on the floor, a pair of scissors protruding ominously from her chest, the crimson stain spreading across her uniform. "A grim scene indeed," he muttered, his articulate voice echoing in the vast, empty space. 

Gathered nearby were the only four people who could have been present at the time of the murder: the Farmer, the Firefighter, the Rabbi, and the Maid. "No one else could have been here," he noted, his eyes scanning the room for any overlooked details. 

Detecto began his investigation, probing the suspects with questions and observing their reactions. The Farmer, a scarred and absent-minded man, seemed lost in thought, and Detecto noted the dust and cobwebs clinging to his clothes, a testament to his claim of being in the attic. "I found an old baseball glove up there," the Farmer recounted, a hint of nostalgia in his blunt manner. "It reminded me of childhood games and how my grandmother used to bake cookies in that very attic."

Turning his attention to the Firefighter, Detecto listened as the man explained, "Tensions had been rising between me and Policeman due to her constant criticism of my methods." The Firefighter admitted to bringing a pair of scissors to the auditorium, ostensibly for cutting materials for the presentation. "We were preparing for a community safety presentation," he said, his casual tone belying the gravity of the situation. "I swear I'm innocent," he protested, though Detecto couldn't help but notice the underlying resentment in his words, a resentment that hinted at a deeper motive.

The Maid, a friendly man with grey hair, insisted on his innocence, stating, "I was in the kitchen, preparing refreshments, when the murder occurred." As he arranged snacks, he recalled a humorous mishap from a previous event, his eloquent manner softening the tension in the room. Yet, Detecto couldn't ignore the Maid's proximity to the scene of the crime, a fact that might raise suspicions among others.

The Rabbi, a blonde woman with a drawling manner, also protested her innocence, claiming she was in the kitchen with the Maid. "I was focused on my work," she explained, "and had no idea what was happening in the auditorium." As she prepared snacks, she chuckled at a funny-shaped cucumber and hummed a childhood tune, her demeanor seemingly carefree. However, Detecto's keen eye caught a glimpse of a ceremonial knife among her belongings, though she assured him it was never intended for harm.

Detecto's mind raced as he pieced together the fragments of each story, noting the Farmer's unease about his absence during the murder and the dust on his clothes that corroborated his alibi. The Maid's proximity to the kitchen and his innocent demeanor seemed genuine, yet Detecto remained cautious. The Rabbi's access to a knife was intriguing, but her story held consistency. 

Finally, Detecto turned his attention back to the Firefighter, whose frustration with the Policeman's authority and the presence of scissors in the auditorium painted a compelling picture. "It must be one of these suspects," Detecto mused, his articulate voice barely above a whisper as he prepared to reveal the truth.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Policeman?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Farmer
- B: Rabbi
- C: Firefighter
- D: Maid

## Correct Answer

The killer is Firefighter

## Reasoning

- [DURING_CRIME]	I was focused on my work, and I had no idea what was happening in the auditorium. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Rabbi)
- [DURING_CRIME]	When the murder occurred, Maid was still in the kitchen, completely absorbed in his preparations. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Maid)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	The detective finds dust and cobwebs on Farmer's clothes, indicating he had indeed been in the attic and not in the auditorium. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Farmer)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Firefighter felt overshadowed by Policeman's authority and success. He believed that her constant criticism of his work and her condescending attitude had damaged his reputation among their peers. This resentment built over time, leading him to fantasize about a world where he could finally gain respect and recognition without her presence. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Firefighter)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a pair of scissors, which were readily available in the auditorium where the two often met for community events. The scissors were sharp and could easily be concealed in Firefighter's pocket. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Firefighter)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Policeman was vulnerable during a rehearsal for a community safety presentation. She was alone in the auditorium, focused on her notes and unaware of Firefighter's approach. The dim lighting and the sound of the rehearsal muffled any noise, allowing Firefighter to act without immediate detection. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Firefighter)

### Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a pair of scissors, which were readily available in the auditorium where the two often met for community events. The scissors were sharp and could easily be concealed in Firefighter's pocket.
Motive: Firefighter felt overshadowed by Policeman's authority and success. He believed that her constant criticism of his work and her condescending attitude had damaged his reputation among their peers. This resentment built over time, leading him to fantasize about a world where he could finally gain respect and recognition without her presence.
Opportunity: Policeman was vulnerable during a rehearsal for a community safety presentation. She was alone in the auditorium, focused on her notes and unaware of Firefighter's approach. The dim lighting and the sound of the rehearsal muffled any noise, allowing Firefighter to act without immediate detection.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Firefighter and Policeman were preparing for a community safety presentation in the auditorium. They had been working together for several weeks, but tensions had been rising due to Policeman's critical remarks about Firefighter's methods. On the day of the murder, Firefighter arrived early to set up the stage, feeling a mix of frustration and determination. He had brought along a pair of scissors, ostensibly to cut some materials for the presentation, but he had other intentions in mind.

As Policeman entered the auditorium, engrossed in her notes, Firefighter seized the opportunity. The room was dimly lit, and the sound of rehearsing volunteers echoed from another part of the estate, providing the perfect cover. He approached her from behind, his heart racing as he drew the scissors from his pocket. In a swift, calculated motion, he struck, ensuring that her surprise and confusion would be short-lived. The act was quick, driven by a mix of anger and desperation to silence her once and for all.

Afterward, Firefighter quickly concealed the scissors in a nearby prop box and stepped out of the auditorium, trying to maintain his composure. He mingled with the other guests, feigning normalcy while his mind raced with thoughts of what he had just done. He engaged in casual conversation, laughing and joking, all the while keeping a watchful eye on the auditorium door, waiting for someone to discover Policeman's body. The thrill of having taken control of his own narrative filled him with a sense of power, even as he knew the consequences of his actions could soon unravel.


Story to Detective: 


I was just doing my job, you know? Preparing for the community safety presentation with Policeman. We had been working together for a while, and sure, there were some disagreements, but that’s normal, right? I mean, she had her way of doing things, and I had mine. I thought we were making progress, but it felt like she was always looking down on me, like I was some kind of rookie. So, yeah, I was a little frustrated, but I didn’t think it was anything serious. Just a typical day at work, really.

When I got to the auditorium, I was focused on setting up the stage. I had some materials to cut, and I brought a pair of scissors with me. I remember thinking about how important this presentation was for the community, and I wanted to make sure everything went smoothly. Policeman came in, and she seemed really absorbed in her notes. I thought it was a good time to go over the details with her, but she didn’t seem interested in listening. I mean, she was just so wrapped up in her own world, and I was trying to get her attention. It was frustrating, but I didn’t think anything of it.

After that, I stepped out of the auditorium to grab some fresh air. I was feeling a bit overwhelmed, you know? I just wanted to clear my head. I ran into some of the other guests and started chatting with them, trying to act normal. I didn’t want anyone to think anything was off. I mean, it was just a rehearsal, right? I didn’t see anything unusual, and I certainly didn’t hear anything that would make me think something was wrong. I was just there, trying to keep things light and fun, like I always do.

### Parsed Story for Rabbi

Means: Rabbi had access to a ceremonial knife used for religious purposes, but she had no intention of using it for harm.
Motive: None.
Opportunity: Rabbi was in the mansion's kitchen preparing refreshments for the presentation when the murder occurred.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Rabbi was busy in the mansion's kitchen, preparing a variety of snacks and drinks for the community safety presentation. She had been looking forward to the event, hoping to foster a sense of community among the attendees. However, earlier that day, she had a heated argument with Policeman regarding the presentation's content. Rabbi felt that Policeman was dismissive of her ideas, which left her feeling frustrated and upset, but she had no intention of harming her.

When the murder occurred, Rabbi was still in the kitchen, arranging the refreshments and chatting with the Maid, who was helping her. They were both focused on their tasks and unaware of the events unfolding in the auditorium. Rabbi occasionally glanced at the clock, eager for the presentation to start, but she was completely absorbed in her work and did not hear any commotion from the auditorium.

After the murder, Rabbi remained in the kitchen, continuing to prepare the refreshments. When the Maid suddenly rushed in, looking pale and shaken, Rabbi felt a wave of concern. She quickly learned about the tragedy that had taken place in the auditorium. In shock, Rabbi joined the Maid and other guests as they gathered to discuss the incident, her earlier frustration forgotten in the face of such a horrific event.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the kitchen, preparing snacks for the community safety presentation when the tragedy occurred. I had been looking forward to this event, wanting to create a warm atmosphere for everyone. Earlier that day, I had a disagreement with Policeman about the presentation, but it was nothing serious. I was simply frustrated with her dismissive attitude, and I never wished her any harm. I was focused on my work, and I had no idea what was happening in the auditorium.

While I was in the kitchen, I was with the Maid, who was helping me arrange the refreshments. We were both busy chatting and preparing, and I didn't hear anything unusual coming from the auditorium. I was glancing at the clock, eager for the presentation to start, but my attention was entirely on the task at hand. I assure you, I had no opportunity to commit any crime, as I was occupied in the kitchen.

When I learned about Policeman's death, I was horrified. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I immediately felt a wave of concern for everyone involved. I joined the Maid and other guests as we gathered to discuss the tragedy. I may have seemed anxious, but it was only because I was shocked and upset. I had no motive to harm Policeman, and I hope you can see that my actions were innocent, despite the earlier disagreement.


### Parsed Story for Maid

Means: None
Motive: None
Opportunity: Maid was in the kitchen, preparing refreshments, when the murder occurred.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Maid was busy in the mansion's kitchen, meticulously arranging a variety of snacks and drinks for the community safety presentation. He took great pride in his work, ensuring that everything was perfect for the guests. While he was focused on his tasks, he occasionally exchanged friendly banter with Rabbi, who was also in the kitchen. Their camaraderie was evident, but Maid felt a twinge of anxiety about his feelings for her, which he kept hidden.

When the murder occurred, Maid was still in the kitchen, completely absorbed in his preparations. He was unaware of the events unfolding in the auditorium, as the sounds of laughter and chatter from the volunteers rehearsing nearby drowned out any noise from the crime scene. Maid glanced at the clock, eager for the presentation to start, but remained focused on his work, arranging the final touches on the refreshments.

After the murder, Maid was startled when Rabbi rushed into the kitchen, looking pale and shaken. Concerned for her well-being, he listened intently as she shared the shocking news about Policeman's death. Maid joined Rabbi and the other guests in the main area, where they began to discuss the incident. His earlier feelings of anxiety were overshadowed by the tragedy, but he couldn't shake the feeling that his close proximity to the kitchen made him seem suspicious in the eyes of others.


Story to Detective: 


As I stood in the kitchen, I was fully engrossed in preparing the refreshments for the community safety presentation. My focus was entirely on ensuring that everything was perfect for the guests, especially for Rabbi, whose ideas I admired greatly. I had no intention of causing any trouble or harm to anyone, least of all Policeman, with whom I had no quarrel. I was simply doing my job, and I had no idea that anything sinister was happening in the auditorium.

When I heard the commotion, I was startled, but I remained in the kitchen, believing it to be part of the preparations for the event. I was chatting with Rabbi, and we were both so focused on our tasks that we didn't hear anything unusual. It wasn't until she rushed in, looking pale and shaken, that I learned about the tragedy that had unfolded. I felt a wave of shock wash over me, and my heart sank at the thought of such a horrific event occurring so close to us.

I assure you, Detective, I had no motive to harm Policeman. My only concern was for Rabbi and the community we were trying to serve. I was in the kitchen the entire time, and I would never betray the trust of those around me. If anyone should be scrutinized, it might be Firefighter, who had been acting strangely in the days leading up to the presentation. I noticed his frustration with Policeman, and I can't help but wonder if he was hiding something.


### Parsed Story for Farmer

Means: None
Motive: None
Opportunity: Farmer was in the attic when the murder occurred, making him completely unaware of the events in the auditorium.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Farmer was rummaging through the attic of the mansion, searching for a family heirloom that he had misplaced. He had been feeling nostalgic and wanted to share the heirloom with the guests during the community safety presentation. As he sifted through boxes and old furniture, he became increasingly frustrated, as the attic was cluttered and disorganized. He lost track of time, absorbed in his search, and did not hear the sounds of the preparations happening below.

When the murder occurred, Farmer was still in the attic, completely unaware of the chaos unfolding in the auditorium. The sounds of the volunteers rehearsing and the creaking of the old house drowned out any noise from the auditorium. He was focused on finding the heirloom, and his absent-mindedness kept him from noticing how much time had passed. It wasn't until he finally gave up and decided to head back down that he learned about the tragedy.

After the murder, Farmer descended from the attic, feeling a mix of disappointment and confusion. As he entered the main area, he was met with a somber atmosphere and hushed whispers. He quickly learned about Policeman's death and was shocked. Farmer joined the others in discussing the incident, but his earlier search for the heirloom left him feeling disheveled and out of place. He couldn't shake the feeling that his absence during the murder might make him seem suspicious to the others.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the attic before the murder, looking for an old family heirloom that I thought might be up there. I had been meaning to share it with everyone during the presentation, but I got caught up in searching through all the old boxes and junk. I didn’t hear anything going on below because the attic is so isolated and noisy. I was just trying to find something meaningful to contribute, but I lost track of time.

When I finally decided to head back down, I had no idea what had happened. I was shocked when I came into the main area and saw everyone looking so grim. I thought maybe something had gone wrong with the presentation, but then I learned about Policeman's death. I couldn’t believe it. I had no reason to want her dead; we didn’t have any issues, and I was just focused on my own stuff.

I know it might look suspicious that I was up in the attic when the murder happened, but I swear I had nothing to do with it. I was just a guy looking for a family heirloom. I didn’t even know there was trouble until I came down. I think it’s unfair to think I could have done something when I was so far away from the auditorium. If you want to know more, you can ask Rabbi and Maid; they were in the kitchen the whole time and can vouch for me.

It Takes Place In: Private island estate
The Crime Happened In: Auditorium
Other Locations in the Story: Mansion, Attic

The Murder Weapon: Scissors
Other Suspicious Items: Bat

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Scissors in the Auditorium by Firefighter, killing Policeman. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In the secluded realm of a private island estate, a tragic crime unfolds in the auditorium, claiming the life of a seasoned policewoman. As the mysterious circumstances surrounding her death begin to unravel, the enigmatic Detective Detecto finds himself in a web of deceit, danger, and unexpected alliances. Can he navigate this labyrinth of suspicion and secrecy to unmask the killer before the final curtain falls?

Firefighter's Story to the Detective: 


I was just doing my job, you know? Preparing for the community safety presentation with Policeman. We had been working together for a while, and sure, there were some disagreements, but that’s normal, right? I mean, she had her way of doing things, and I had mine. I thought we were making progress, but it felt like she was always looking down on me, like I was some kind of rookie. So, yeah, I was a little frustrated, but I didn’t think it was anything serious. Just a typical day at work, really.

When I got to the auditorium, I was focused on setting up the stage. I had some materials to cut, and I brought a pair of scissors with me. I remember thinking about how important this presentation was for the community, and I wanted to make sure everything went smoothly. Policeman came in, and she seemed really absorbed in her notes. I thought it was a good time to go over the details with her, but she didn’t seem interested in listening. I mean, she was just so wrapped up in her own world, and I was trying to get her attention. It was frustrating, but I didn’t think anything of it.

After that, I stepped out of the auditorium to grab some fresh air. I was feeling a bit overwhelmed, you know? I just wanted to clear my head. I ran into some of the other guests and started chatting with them, trying to act normal. I didn’t want anyone to think anything was off. I mean, it was just a rehearsal, right? I didn’t see anything unusual, and I certainly didn’t hear anything that would make me think something was wrong. I was just there, trying to keep things light and fun, like I always do.

Rabbi's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the kitchen, preparing snacks for the community safety presentation when the tragedy occurred. I had been looking forward to this event, wanting to create a warm atmosphere for everyone. Earlier that day, I had a disagreement with Policeman about the presentation, but it was nothing serious. I was simply frustrated with her dismissive attitude, and I never wished her any harm. I was focused on my work, and I had no idea what was happening in the auditorium.

While I was in the kitchen, I was with the Maid, who was helping me arrange the refreshments. We were both busy chatting and preparing, and I didn't hear anything unusual coming from the auditorium. I was glancing at the clock, eager for the presentation to start, but my attention was entirely on the task at hand. I assure you, I had no opportunity to commit any crime, as I was occupied in the kitchen.

When I learned about Policeman's death, I was horrified. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I immediately felt a wave of concern for everyone involved. I joined the Maid and other guests as we gathered to discuss the tragedy. I may have seemed anxious, but it was only because I was shocked and upset. I had no motive to harm Policeman, and I hope you can see that my actions were innocent, despite the earlier disagreement.


Maid's Story to the Detective: 


As I stood in the kitchen, I was fully engrossed in preparing the refreshments for the community safety presentation. My focus was entirely on ensuring that everything was perfect for the guests, especially for Rabbi, whose ideas I admired greatly. I had no intention of causing any trouble or harm to anyone, least of all Policeman, with whom I had no quarrel. I was simply doing my job, and I had no idea that anything sinister was happening in the auditorium.

When I heard the commotion, I was startled, but I remained in the kitchen, believing it to be part of the preparations for the event. I was chatting with Rabbi, and we were both so focused on our tasks that we didn't hear anything unusual. It wasn't until she rushed in, looking pale and shaken, that I learned about the tragedy that had unfolded. I felt a wave of shock wash over me, and my heart sank at the thought of such a horrific event occurring so close to us.

I assure you, Detective, I had no motive to harm Policeman. My only concern was for Rabbi and the community we were trying to serve. I was in the kitchen the entire time, and I would never betray the trust of those around me. If anyone should be scrutinized, it might be Firefighter, who had been acting strangely in the days leading up to the presentation. I noticed his frustration with Policeman, and I can't help but wonder if he was hiding something.


Farmer's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the attic before the murder, looking for an old family heirloom that I thought might be up there. I had been meaning to share it with everyone during the presentation, but I got caught up in searching through all the old boxes and junk. I didn’t hear anything going on below because the attic is so isolated and noisy. I was just trying to find something meaningful to contribute, but I lost track of time.

When I finally decided to head back down, I had no idea what had happened. I was shocked when I came into the main area and saw everyone looking so grim. I thought maybe something had gone wrong with the presentation, but then I learned about Policeman's death. I couldn’t believe it. I had no reason to want her dead; we didn’t have any issues, and I was just focused on my own stuff.

I know it might look suspicious that I was up in the attic when the murder happened, but I swear I had nothing to do with it. I was just a guy looking for a family heirloom. I didn’t even know there was trouble until I came down. I think it’s unfair to think I could have done something when I was so far away from the auditorium. If you want to know more, you can ask Rabbi and Maid; they were in the kitchen the whole time and can vouch for me.

The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.
You should use dialog to convey information engage the reader.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point, narrated by Detecto and using dialog where appropriate.

### Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the private island estate, his pale complexion contrasting sharply with the vibrant surroundings, as he stepped into the auditorium where the lifeless body of the Policeman lay sprawled on the floor, a pair of scissors protruding ominously from her chest, the crimson stain spreading across her uniform. "A grim scene indeed," he muttered, his articulate voice echoing in the vast, empty space. 

Gathered nearby were the only four people who could have been present at the time of the murder: the Farmer, the Firefighter, the Rabbi, and the Maid. "No one else could have been here," he noted, his eyes scanning the room for any overlooked details. 

Detecto began his investigation, probing the suspects with questions and observing their reactions. The Farmer, a scarred and absent-minded man, seemed lost in thought, and Detecto noted the dust and cobwebs clinging to his clothes, a testament to his claim of being in the attic. "I found an old baseball glove up there," the Farmer recounted, a hint of nostalgia in his blunt manner. "It reminded me of childhood games and how my grandmother used to bake cookies in that very attic."

Turning his attention to the Firefighter, Detecto listened as the man explained, "Tensions had been rising between me and Policeman due to her constant criticism of my methods." The Firefighter admitted to bringing a pair of scissors to the auditorium, ostensibly for cutting materials for the presentation. "We were preparing for a community safety presentation," he said, his casual tone belying the gravity of the situation. "I swear I'm innocent," he protested, though Detecto couldn't help but notice the underlying resentment in his words, a resentment that hinted at a deeper motive.

The Maid, a friendly man with grey hair, insisted on his innocence, stating, "I was in the kitchen, preparing refreshments, when the murder occurred." As he arranged snacks, he recalled a humorous mishap from a previous event, his eloquent manner softening the tension in the room. Yet, Detecto couldn't ignore the Maid's proximity to the scene of the crime, a fact that might raise suspicions among others.

The Rabbi, a blonde woman with a drawling manner, also protested her innocence, claiming she was in the kitchen with the Maid. "I was focused on my work," she explained, "and had no idea what was happening in the auditorium." As she prepared snacks, she chuckled at a funny-shaped cucumber and hummed a childhood tune, her demeanor seemingly carefree. However, Detecto's keen eye caught a glimpse of a ceremonial knife among her belongings, though she assured him it was never intended for harm.

Detecto's mind raced as he pieced together the fragments of each story, noting the Farmer's unease about his absence during the murder and the dust on his clothes that corroborated his alibi. The Maid's proximity to the kitchen and his innocent demeanor seemed genuine, yet Detecto remained cautious. The Rabbi's access to a knife was intriguing, but her story held consistency. 

Finally, Detecto turned his attention back to the Firefighter, whose frustration with the Policeman's authority and the presence of scissors in the auditorium painted a compelling picture. "It must be one of these suspects," Detecto mused, his articulate voice barely above a whisper as he prepared to reveal the truth.

* B: Rabbi
* C: Firefighter
* D: Maid

### Text

Interactive mode disabled. The killer was Firefighter.

### Bullet Points: Reasoning

* [DURING_CRIME]	I was focused on my work, and I had no idea what was happening in the auditorium. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Rabbi)
* [DURING_CRIME]	When the murder occurred, Maid was still in the kitchen, completely absorbed in his preparations. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Maid)
* [AFTER_CRIME]	The detective finds dust and cobwebs on Farmer's clothes, indicating he had indeed been in the attic and not in the auditorium. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Farmer)
* [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
* [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Firefighter felt overshadowed by Policeman's authority and success. He believed that her constant criticism of his work and her condescending attitude had damaged his reputation among their peers. This resentment built over time, leading him to fantasize about a world where he could finally gain respect and recognition without her presence. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Firefighter)
* [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a pair of scissors, which were readily available in the auditorium where the two often met for community events. The scissors were sharp and could easily be concealed in Firefighter's pocket. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Firefighter)
* [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Policeman was vulnerable during a rehearsal for a community safety presentation. She was alone in the auditorium, focused on her notes and unaware of Firefighter's approach. The dim lighting and the sound of the rehearsal muffled any noise, allowing Firefighter to act without immediate detection. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Firefighter)
