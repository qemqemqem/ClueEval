# Melody of the Monastery Murder

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the monastery, his keen eyes immediately drawn to the lifeless form of the Musician sprawled on the apartment floor, a dagger protruding from his chest, the crimson stain spreading ominously across the carpet. The air was thick with tension as he surveyed the scene, noting the four individuals present: the Guard, the Butcher, the Firefighter, and the Nurseâ€”each a potential suspect in this grim tableau. 

Detecto began his inquiry with the Butcher, who stood wringing her hands, her voice a melodic protest, "I swear, Detective, I was in the common area, lost in my thoughts and the card game, completely unaware of anything happening next door." Her eyes darted nervously, betraying her concealed anxiety about the vase she had accidentally shattered, a detail she hoped would remain hidden. 

Turning to the Firefighter, Detecto observed the young man's casual demeanor as he declared, "I was just trying to enjoy myself in the common area, but that music was so loud, I couldn't hear a thing." The Firefighter's attempt to lighten the mood with a story about burning pasta and a joke about a horror-movie-worthy plant seemed to mask a deeper unease. 

The Guard, with her dramatic flair, recounted, "I was in the cellar, organizing supplies, when I found an old board game that brought back fond memories." Her claim of innocence was bolstered by the fact that the cellar had been locked from the inside, a detail Detecto noted with interest. 

Detecto's attention then shifted to the Nurse, whose mumbling protest, "I-I-I was just in the kitchen, preparing a snack," seemed to conceal a deeper resentment. The detective's sharp intuition picked up on the Nurse's underlying bitterness towards the Musician, a sentiment that had festered over time. 

The Butcher's alibi was corroborated by witnesses who confirmed her presence in the common area, never venturing near the Musician's apartment. Meanwhile, the Guard's insistence on her innocence was supported by the locked cellar door, which could not have been breached without her knowledge. 

The Nurse's story faltered as he stammered, "It all went dark after I lost control," a slip that Detecto noted with a discerning eye. The Firefighter's sarcastic remarks and eagerness to deflect suspicion onto the Nurse only served to heighten the detective's scrutiny. 

Detecto observed the Firefighter's lack of access to the dagger, a crucial piece of evidence that seemed to exonerate him. The Guard's actions, though suspicious, were consistent with her role in ensuring the safety of the residents. 

As the Nurse paced, rehearsing his alibi, Detecto pieced together the subtle clues, his mind a whirl of deductions and possibilities. It was clear that one of these individuals was responsible for the heinous act, and with a knowing glance, Detecto prepared to reveal the truth.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Musician?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Guard
- B: Firefighter
- C: Nurse
- D: Butcher

## Correct Answer

The killer is Nurse

## Reasoning

- [DURING_CRIME]	The cellar was locked from the inside, and no one could have entered or exited without her knowledge, making it impossible for her to commit the murder. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Guard)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	The detective finds that Firefighter had no access to the murder weapon, the dagger, as he was not in the kitchen or Musician's apartment at the time of the crime. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Firefighter)
- [DURING_CRIME]	Witnesses confirm that Butcher was engaged in her own tasks in the common area and did not leave to go to Musician's apartment during the time of the murder. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Butcher)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Nurse felt deeply undervalued and disrespected by Musician, who often belittled his work and made snide remarks about his stuttering. This constant humiliation fostered a growing resentment, leading Nurse to fantasize about a world where Musician no longer existed. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Nurse)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a dagger, a sharp and lethal weapon that Nurse had access to in the monastery's kitchen, where various tools were kept for food preparation. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Nurse)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Musician was vulnerable during the late evening hours when he was alone in his apartment, having just finished a rehearsal. The monastery was quiet, and the other residents were occupied with their own activities, providing Nurse with the perfect chance to act without being seen. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Nurse)
