# Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a bow and arrow, which Nurse had access to as a part of the club's archery equipment. The weapon was typically stored in the ballroom, where members often engaged in recreational activities.
Motive: Nurse had a longstanding resentment towards Farmer due to her dismissive attitude towards the elderly and her constant complaints about the club's services, which Nurse felt were unfairly directed at him. This resentment festered over time, leading Nurse to believe that eliminating Farmer would restore peace to the club and improve the atmosphere for everyone else.
Opportunity: Farmer was vulnerable to attack during a club event in the ballroom, where she was distracted by her conversation with other members. The atmosphere was lively, and the noise masked any potential sounds of struggle or distress, providing Nurse with the perfect moment to strike.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Nurse was in the lounge, casually chatting with a few members about the upcoming club events. He appeared absent-minded, occasionally losing track of the conversation, but his eyes were keenly observing Farmer, who was in the ballroom, grumbling about the food and service. As the evening progressed, Nurse felt a surge of frustration at Farmer's complaints, which had been a constant source of irritation for him. He decided to take a break from the chatter and wandered toward the ballroom, where he noticed the archery equipment set up for a demonstration.

In the ballroom, the atmosphere was festive, with laughter and music filling the air. Farmer stood near the center, her back turned to Nurse as she engaged in a heated discussion with the Baker about the quality of the club's produce. Seizing the moment, Nurse quietly approached the archery setup, selecting a bow and arrow with a steady hand. With a quick glance around to ensure no one was watching, he drew the bowstring back and aimed carefully, letting the arrow fly just as Farmer turned her head, catching her off guard.

After the deed was done, Nurse quickly returned the bow and arrow to their place, feigning innocence as he mingled with the other members. He maintained a casual demeanor, chatting with the Fisherman about the weather, all the while keeping an eye on the ballroom. When the commotion began, and Farmer was discovered, Nurse feigned shock and concern, blending in with the crowd as he listened to the chaos unfold, carefully crafting his alibi in the midst of the panic.


Story to Detective: 


I was just minding my own business, you know? I was in the lounge, talking about the upcoming events with some of the members. I tend to drift off sometimes, but I was listening to them complain about the food. Farmer was in the ballroom, and I could hear her grumbling from where I was. She always had something to say, didn’t she? It just got under my skin after a while. I thought I’d take a stroll to the ballroom, maybe get a breath of fresh air, and see what all the fuss was about.

When I got to the ballroom, it was lively, and I could see Farmer in the middle of it all, arguing with the Baker. I figured I’d just hang back for a moment, let them have their fun. I noticed the archery equipment set up for a demonstration, and I thought, why not? I picked up the bow, just to have a look, you know? I didn’t mean anything by it. I was just standing there, watching the party, when suddenly, it all went wrong. I swear I didn’t see it coming, and then there was a commotion, and people were panicking. It was all so sudden.

I didn’t know what to do, so I just stayed calm, like I always do. I went back to chatting with the Fisherman, trying to keep things light. I mean, what else could I do? I didn’t want to draw attention to myself. When they found Farmer, I was just as shocked as everyone else. I was right there, you see? I couldn’t have done anything. I was just trying to enjoy the evening like everyone else. It’s all a terrible misunderstanding, really.

When the murder took place, Fisherman was still in the lounge, surrounded by other members who were enjoying drinks and snacks.

I couldn’t believe it when I saw Farmer lying there. It was surreal, and I felt a wave of panic wash over me.

Afterward, I stayed in the ballroom, trying to help and understand what had happened. I was just as shocked as everyone else. I didn’t know what to think, but I could see how my earlier argument with Farmer might make me look suspicious. I didn’t want to be blamed for something I didn’t do.

# Full Prose Prompt

I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

## Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

This is a mystery story in the style of a golden age classic. The story features the following elements:

Victim: Farmer (a 33-year-old woman, short and grumpy, who speaks in a blunt manner)
Killer: Nurse (a 70-year-old man, lanky and absent-minded, who speaks in a casual manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 45-year-old non-binary person, redhead and meticulous, who speaks in a articulate manner)

Other Characters:
Fisherman (a 19-year-old woman, scarred and meticulous, who speaks in a gravelly manner), Baker (a 55-year-old woman, tanned and outgoing, who speaks in a enthusiastic manner), Chauffeur (a 32-year-old man, redhead and mean, who speaks in a blunt manner)

It Takes Place In: Exclusive members-only club
The Crime Happened In: Ballroom
Other Locations in the Story: Lounge, Hot Tub

The Murder Weapon: Bow And Arrow
Other Suspicious Items: Rifle

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Bow And Arrow in the Ballroom by Nurse, killing Farmer. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In the grandeur of an exclusive members-only club, a grumpy farmer woman meets her end in the ballroom, pierced by a bow and arrow. As Detective Detecto wades through a sea of eccentric suspects and a chilling side mystery involving a rifle, they must unravel the deadly intentions of a seemingly absent-minded nurse.

Nurse's Story to the Detective: 


I was just minding my own business, you know? I was in the lounge, talking about the upcoming events with some of the members. I tend to drift off sometimes, but I was listening to them complain about the food. Farmer was in the ballroom, and I could hear her grumbling from where I was. She always had something to say, didn’t she? It just got under my skin after a while. I thought I’d take a stroll to the ballroom, maybe get a breath of fresh air, and see what all the fuss was about.

When I got to the ballroom, it was lively, and I could see Farmer in the middle of it all, arguing with the Baker. I figured I’d just hang back for a moment, let them have their fun. I noticed the archery equipment set up for a demonstration, and I thought, why not? I picked up the bow, just to have a look, you know? I didn’t mean anything by it. I was just standing there, watching the party, when suddenly, it all went wrong. I swear I didn’t see it coming, and then there was a commotion, and people were panicking. It was all so sudden.

I didn’t know what to do, so I just stayed calm, like I always do. I went back to chatting with the Fisherman, trying to keep things light. I mean, what else could I do? I didn’t want to draw attention to myself. When they found Farmer, I was just as shocked as everyone else. I was right there, you see? I couldn’t have done anything. I was just trying to enjoy the evening like everyone else. It’s all a terrible misunderstanding, really.

Fisherman's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the lounge before the murder, talking about the fishing tournament with some of the other members. We were all excited, sharing tips and stories about our best catches. Sure, I had a disagreement with Farmer earlier about the fish served at the club, but it was just a heated discussion. I didn’t want her dead; I just wanted her to understand my point of view. I was frustrated, but I would never take it that far.

When the murder happened, I was still in the lounge. I was completely unaware of what was going on in the ballroom. The music was loud, and I was focused on my conversation. I didn’t even notice when the atmosphere shifted until I heard the screams. I was shocked and confused, and I rushed into the ballroom to see what had happened. I couldn’t believe it when I saw Farmer lying there. It was surreal, and I felt a wave of panic wash over me.

Afterward, I stayed in the ballroom, trying to help and understand what had happened. I was just as shocked as everyone else. I didn’t know what to think, but I could see how my earlier argument with Farmer might make me look suspicious. I didn’t want to be blamed for something I didn’t do. I just want to clear my name and find out who really did this. I think the Nurse was acting a bit strange, too, but I didn’t see anything specific. 


Baker's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the kitchen before the murder, preparing pastries for the evening event. I was excited about the dessert contest coming up and was chatting with the kitchen staff, trying to make sure everything was perfect. Earlier in the day, I had a bit of a spat with Farmer about the quality of the produce. She was quite blunt, and I felt embarrassed afterward, but I didn’t think much of it. I just wanted to focus on my baking and make the best desserts for the club.

When the murder happened, I was in the lounge, talking with other members about the contest. We were all laughing and enjoying ourselves, and I didn’t even notice anything was wrong until I heard the commotion from the ballroom. I was completely engrossed in my conversation, and I had no idea that Farmer was in danger. I thought everything was going well, and I was just trying to have a good time with everyone.

After the chaos erupted, I rushed into the ballroom, and my heart sank when I saw Farmer. I was shocked and horrified, and I immediately tried to help. I wanted to comfort the others and figure out what had happened. I know my earlier argument with Farmer might make me look suspicious, but I would never harm her. I was just trying to enjoy the evening and support my fellow club members.


Chauffeur's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the lounge before the murder, serving drinks and chatting with the members. I had a bit of a spat with Farmer earlier in the day about her complaints regarding the club's service, which left me feeling pretty irritated. I was just trying to keep my head down and do my job when the murder happened. I didn't even know anything was wrong until I heard the commotion from the ballroom.

When the chaos erupted, I was still in the lounge, surrounded by other members. I was busy pouring drinks and engaging in small talk, so I had no idea what was going on in the ballroom. I didn't have any opportunity to attack Farmer because I was right there with everyone else, completely focused on my duties. I know it might look suspicious since I had that earlier argument with her, but I didn't want her dead or anything like that.

After the murder, I rushed into the ballroom with the others to see what had happened. I was shocked to see Farmer's body, and I immediately tried to help. I know people might think I had something to do with it because of our earlier argument, but I swear I didn't. I was just doing my job, and I had no means to commit the crime. I didn't even have access to the bow and arrow or any weapon at all.

## Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.
You should use dialog to convey information engage the reader.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point, narrated by Detecto and using dialog where appropriate.

# Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the exclusive members-only club, their keen eyes immediately drawn to the lifeless body of Farmer sprawled across the ballroom floor, an arrow protruding from her chest, surrounded by a pool of crimson. The detective surveyed the scene with meticulous care, noting the four individuals present: Chauffeur, Baker, Nurse, and Fisherman, each with their own potential motives and alibis. 

Detecto began their investigation by questioning Baker, who vehemently protested her innocence, insisting, "I was in the lounge, chatting with other members about the dessert contest when it happened." Despite her protests, Detecto noted Baker's earlier tense exchange with Farmer over the quality of the club's produce, a detail that could not be ignored. 

As Detecto continued to probe, Baker casually mentioned, "While waiting for the event to start, I saw a stray cat outside the window and joked about how it looked like it was judging my baking skills." This seemingly innocuous comment did little to alleviate suspicion, but multiple witnesses confirmed Baker's presence in the lounge during the murder, providing her with a solid alibi.

Turning to the Chauffeur, Detecto listened as he recounted, "I had a spat with Farmer earlier about her complaints regarding the club's service, which left me feeling pretty irritated." The Chauffeur's annoyance was palpable, yet several club members vouched for his presence in the lounge, making it improbable for him to have slipped away unnoticed.

Fisherman, with a gravelly voice, admitted, "I had a tense exchange with Farmer about the fish served at the club, but I was just frustrated, not vengeful." Her words were underscored by the peculiar aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the scent of old wood in the lounge, a sensory detail that transported her back to her grandfather's fishing cabin. 

Detecto's attention then shifted to Nurse, who appeared absent-minded yet protested, "I was just in the lounge, chatting about upcoming events when it all happened." Despite his casual demeanor, Detecto observed Nurse's keen eyes, which betrayed a longstanding resentment towards Farmer due to her dismissive attitude and constant complaints. 

Detecto's suspicions deepened as they pieced together that Nurse had access to the club's archery equipment stored in the ballroom, a fact he had conveniently omitted. The lively atmosphere of the club event provided the perfect cover for Nurse to strike unnoticed, a realization that dawned on Detecto as they recalled Nurse's earlier comment about a painting of a cat wearing a monocle that always made him chuckle.

As the investigation unfolded, Detecto noted Fisherman's earlier confrontation with Farmer, which cast a shadow of suspicion over her, despite her insistence, "I was completely unaware of what was going on in the ballroom." Her protestations were echoed by the decorative fish tank she noticed upon entering the ballroom, filled with vibrant tropical fish, a detail that seemed to momentarily distract her from the gravity of the situation.

With each suspect's story meticulously dissected, Detecto's mind whirred with the possibilities, each piece of evidence carefully weighed and considered. The detective's eyes scanned the room one final time, confident in their deductions, ready to reveal the truth behind Farmer's untimely demise.
