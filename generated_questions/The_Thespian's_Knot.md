# The Thespian's Knot

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the exclusive boarding school, her gravelly voice cutting through the tense atmosphere as she surveyed the scene of the crime. The bathroom was a grim tableau, with the lawyer's lifeless body sprawled on the floor, the rope still cruelly entwined around his neck. Only four people were present: the Artist, the Sailor, the Chauffeur, and the Actor, each with their own peculiarities and potential motives. 

Detecto began her investigation, her keen eyes and sharp mind piecing together the puzzle from the fragments of conversation and the subtle clues scattered about. The Actor, a lanky and clumsy man, protested his innocence, claiming, "I assure you, Detective, I had no part in this dreadful affair." Yet, Detecto noticed the Actor's hands trembled slightly when he spoke of the Lawyer's earlier jest about his dance moves, a seemingly innocuous comment that had everyone laughing.

The Artist, with his dramatic flair, insisted, "I was not in the bathroom, nor did I have any motive to harm Lawyer," but Detecto's attention was drawn to the paintbrush tucked into his pocket, a potential weapon in the wrong hands. Despite his protests, the Artist's habit of doodling on napkins during conversations seemed to amuse the guests, providing him with an alibi as he mingled in the ballroom when the murder occurred.

The Chauffeur, pale and grumpy, maintained, "I had no knowledge of any confrontation happening in the bathroom," yet Detecto couldn't ignore the fact that he had access to the area, though he lacked any weapon. His formal manner did little to mask his financial troubles, but his alibi was solid, as he was busy driving guests to and from the school during the time of the murder.

The Sailor, with her enthusiastic demeanor, declared, "I had no motive to harm Lawyer," her clumsy enthusiasm evident as she recounted bumping into several people in her excitement. Detecto noted her genuine surprise at the commotion, as she had been dancing and complimenting the ornate chandeliers in the ballroom when the crime took place.

As Detecto pieced together the evening's events, she observed the Actor rejoining the party, feigning ignorance about the commotion, while the Artist, in his haste, stumbled and knocked over a decorative vase, adding to the chaos. The Chauffeur hurried back inside upon hearing the commotion, while the Sailor's eagerness to help only added to the suspicion surrounding her actions.

Detecto's mind raced as she considered the evidence, each suspect's story weaving a complex tapestry of motives and opportunities. It must be one of these suspects, and Detecto knew just who it was.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Lawyer?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Chauffeur
- B: Actor
- C: Artist
- D: Sailor

## Correct Answer

The killer is Actor

## Reasoning

- [BEFORE_CRIME]	I had no knowledge of any confrontation happening in the bathroom. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Chauffeur)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	I had no motive to harm Lawyer. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Sailor)
- [BEFORE_CRIME]	I was not in the bathroom, nor did I have any motive to harm Lawyer. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Artist)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Actor wanted Lawyer dead because he felt overshadowed by Lawyer's success and influence in the legal world. Actor believed that Lawyer had sabotaged his career by spreading rumors that tarnished his reputation, leading to a series of failed auditions and diminishing roles. This resentment festered over time, culminating in a desire for revenge. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Actor)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a length of rope, which Actor had brought with him for a theatrical prop. The rope was initially intended for a scene in a play, but it became the instrument of the crime. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Actor)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Lawyer was vulnerable to attack when he was alone in the bathroom, a secluded area where he felt safe and secure. The timing coincided with a break in the evening's activities, allowing Actor to approach without raising suspicion. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Actor)
