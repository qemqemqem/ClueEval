# The Crimson Harvest

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the secluded country estate, her enthusiasm undeterred by the grim scene awaiting her in the apartment. The victim, Farmer, lay lifeless on the floor, the brutal evidence of an axe attack unmistakable in the crimson stains that marred the room. As she surveyed the scene, Detecto noted the presence of four individuals: Waiter, Bartender, Maid, and Nanny, the only possible witnesses or suspects in this isolated setting.

Detecto began her inquiry with Bartender, who insisted, "I was in the drawing room, preparing for a small gathering when Farmer was attacked." Despite his protests of innocence, Detecto's keen eye caught the faint scent of fresh wood on his hands, suggesting recent contact with the axe stored in the shed. "While arranging the snacks," Bartender continued, "I remembered last year's gathering when the cake fell over, and I was experimenting with new cocktail recipes." His mention of wilting flowers in the drawing room seemed an attempt to divert attention, but Detecto remained focused.

Turning to Maid, Detecto listened as she recounted, "I accidentally knocked over a valuable vase and was busy cleaning up the mess." Her story of humming a catchy jingle while tidying up seemed plausible, yet Detecto noticed the absence of any weapon among her cleaning supplies. "I often talk to the plants in the garden," Maid added, her monotone voice betraying no hint of deceit. The broken vase and scattered cleaning tools confirmed her preoccupation with her duties, leaving her with little opportunity for murder.

Nanny, with a terse demeanor, claimed, "I was in the kitchen, trying to act casual as the others gathered." Detecto sensed an underlying tension in his words, a hint of resentment towards Farmer's dismissive attitude. The detective's intuition told her that Nanny's familiarity with the axe, often used for estate chores, was more than coincidental. His protest of innocence was unconvincing, as Detecto noted the subtle shift in his gaze when discussing Farmer's vulnerability.

Finally, Waiter, with an air of absent-mindedness, stated, "I was in the kitchen preparing lunch when the murder occurred." Her enthusiasm seemed genuine, and Detecto found no motive in her interactions with Farmer. "I think you should look at Nanny more closely," Waiter suggested, her words echoing Detecto's growing suspicion. The detective's investigation revealed Waiter's positive relationship with Farmer, further distancing her from the crime.

As Detecto pieced together the puzzle, she observed the dynamics among the suspects, each with their own secrets and alibis. The evidence pointed in a clear direction, and Detecto knew exactly who had wielded the axe in the apartment.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Farmer?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Maid
- B: Nanny
- C: Bartender
- D: Waiter

## Correct Answer

The killer is Nanny

## Reasoning

- [AFTER_CRIME]	The detective finds the broken vase and the cleaning supplies in the drawing room, confirming that Maid was preoccupied with her cleaning duties and had no access to a weapon. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Maid)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	The detective discovers that Waiter had no motive, as she had a good working relationship with Farmer and was simply trying to maintain a positive atmosphere in the house. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Waiter)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	I was simply trying to create a nice atmosphere for everyone, and I would never dream of hurting Farmer. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Bartender)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Nanny felt undervalued and disrespected by Farmer, who often belittled him and dismissed his contributions to the household. The constant sarcasm and harsh treatment led Nanny to harbor resentment, believing that Farmer's attitude stifled his potential and happiness. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Nanny)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using an axe, which was typically stored in the shed for chopping wood. Nanny had easy access to it, as he often helped with chores around the estate. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Nanny)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Farmer was vulnerable to attack when she was alone in her apartment, taking a break from her daily tasks. This was a time when Nanny knew she would be distracted and less likely to call for help. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Nanny)
