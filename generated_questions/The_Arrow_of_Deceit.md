# The Arrow of Deceit

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the exclusive boarding school, his curly hair catching the light as he surveyed the grim scene before him: the charming Cook lay dead on the kitchen floor, an arrow protruding from her chest, blood pooling beneath her. Only four people were present: the Artist, the Policeman, the Actor, and the Lumberjack, and it was clear that no one else could have been involved. As Detecto began his investigation, he knew that the truth lay hidden among these individuals, each with their own secrets and stories.

The Actor, a lanky and nervous man, claimed he had been alone in the studio, rehearsing his lines, a fact corroborated by the others who had heard his drawling voice echoing through the halls. Despite his protests of innocence, Detecto noted the Actor's concealed access to a revolver left unattended in the studio, though the Actor insisted it was merely a prop for his rehearsals. The Actor's habit of talking to himself during rehearsals was well-known, a method he used to immerse himself in his roles.

The Artist, with her squeaky voice, pointed out that the Policeman had been in the kitchen with Cook just before the murder, a fact that piqued Detecto's interest. Although the Artist protested her innocence, Detecto discerned her concealed resentment towards Cook, stemming from jealousy rather than a true intent to harm. The Artist had been in her studio, painting, unaware of the events in the kitchen, and her humming while she worked was a testament to her focus on her art.

The Lumberjack, a blonde and charming woman, explained that she had been in the hot tub area, relaxing after a long day, and the timer on the hot tub confirmed her alibi. Detecto noticed her concealed concern for the Actor, fearing his nervous demeanor might implicate him, but her own innocence was supported by the duration of her soak. As she soaked, she had been distracted by a family of squirrels, a detail that added to her alibi.

The Policeman, freckled and grumpy, had been in the kitchen ostensibly helping Cook prepare for the evening meal, but Detecto sensed a deeper resentment towards Cook, rooted in a rivalry over the headmaster's favoritism. The murder weapon, a bow and arrow, was linked to the Policeman's involvement in the school's archery club, a fact she had concealed but which Detecto uncovered through her familiarity with the weapon. The kitchen window had been slightly ajar, allowing a breeze to carry the scent of flowers, a detail that seemed innocuous but hinted at the Policeman's opportunity to strike.

The Actor, visibly shaken, struggled to maintain his composure, adding to the suspicion surrounding him as he joined the group in the kitchen, feigning surprise at Cook's lifeless body. The Artist's frantic demeanor raised eyebrows, but other characters, including the Lumberjack, confirmed her presence in the studio during the murder. The Lumberjack suggested that perhaps the Actor's nervousness and the tension between Cook and the Policeman were more telling than her own actions, though she protested her innocence.

Detecto observed the Lumberjack's sudden appearance from the hot tub, her disheveled look making her seem suspicious, but her alibi held firm. After the chaos, she realized she had forgotten her favorite towel, a small detail that seemed irrelevant but added to the picture of her innocence. As Detecto pieced together the evidence, he knew that one of these suspects was the murderer, and he was confident he had unraveled the mystery.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Cook?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Policeman
- B: Actor
- C: Artist
- D: Lumberjack

## Correct Answer

The killer is Policeman

## Reasoning

- [BEFORE_CRIME]	Actor was alone in the studio, and the timing of his rehearsal can be corroborated by the other characters who heard him practicing lines. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Actor)
- [BEFORE_CRIME]	The hot tub's timer shows that Lumberjack had been in the water for a specific duration, making it impossible for her to have committed the murder. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Lumberjack)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	Other characters, including Lumberjack, can confirm that Artist was alone in the studio and did not leave until after the murder had occurred. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Artist)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Policeman harbored deep resentment towards Cook, stemming from a long-standing rivalry over the affections of the school's headmaster. Cook, with her charm and eloquence, had always been favored by the headmaster, which left Policeman feeling overlooked and bitter. This jealousy festered over the years, culminating in a desire to eliminate Cook from the equation entirely. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Policeman)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a bow and arrow, a weapon Policeman had access to due to her involvement in the school's archery club. The bow and arrow were typically stored in the gymnasium, but Policeman had taken them to the kitchen under the pretense of practicing her aim during a quiet moment. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Policeman)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Cook was vulnerable during the late afternoon when she was preparing dinner for the students. The kitchen was bustling with activity, but at that moment, Cook had stepped outside to gather fresh herbs from the garden, leaving her momentarily alone and unguarded. Policeman seized this opportunity to confront Cook and ultimately carry out her deadly plan. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Policeman)

### Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a bow and arrow, a weapon Policeman had access to due to her involvement in the school's archery club. The bow and arrow were typically stored in the gymnasium, but Policeman had taken them to the kitchen under the pretense of practicing her aim during a quiet moment.
Motive: Policeman harbored deep resentment towards Cook, stemming from a long-standing rivalry over the affections of the school's headmaster. Cook, with her charm and eloquence, had always been favored by the headmaster, which left Policeman feeling overlooked and bitter. This jealousy festered over the years, culminating in a desire to eliminate Cook from the equation entirely.
Opportunity: Cook was vulnerable during the late afternoon when she was preparing dinner for the students. The kitchen was bustling with activity, but at that moment, Cook had stepped outside to gather fresh herbs from the garden, leaving her momentarily alone and unguarded. Policeman seized this opportunity to confront Cook and ultimately carry out her deadly plan.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Policeman was in the kitchen, ostensibly helping Cook prepare for the evening meal. The two women exchanged pleasantries, but beneath the surface, tension simmered. Policeman had been waiting for the right moment to confront Cook about the headmaster's favoritism, feeling that it was time to put an end to her perceived injustice. As Cook stepped outside to gather herbs, Policeman saw her chance.

The murder occurred in the kitchen, just as Cook had stepped out into the garden. Policeman retrieved the bow and arrow from where she had hidden it and positioned herself near the kitchen door, waiting for Cook to return. When Cook re-entered, Policeman drew the bow and released the arrow with precision, striking Cook before she could react. The act was swift and brutal, leaving no time for Cook to defend herself.

After the murder, Policeman quickly disposed of the bow and arrow, hiding them back in the gymnasium where they belonged. She returned to the kitchen, feigning shock and horror when the other characters discovered Cook's lifeless body. Policeman maintained her grumpy demeanor, ensuring that no one suspected her involvement. She played the role of the concerned staff member, all the while concealing the dark truth of her actions.


Story to Detective: 


In my account to Detective Detecto, I would express my disbelief at the situation. I would insist that I had been in the kitchen preparing for dinner, just as I always do, when I heard a commotion outside. I would claim that I rushed to the door only to find Cook lying on the floor, an arrow protruding from her body. I would emphasize my shock and horror, painting myself as a victim of circumstance rather than a perpetrator of a crime. 

I would recount how I had been in the kitchen earlier, helping Cook with the meal, and how we had shared a few light-hearted moments. I would stress that I had no reason to harm her, as I was merely doing my job. I would mention how I had stepped away briefly to check on the supplies in the pantry, which would conveniently provide me with an alibi for the time of the murder. 

Throughout my explanation, I would maintain a monotone voice, carefully avoiding any emotional inflection that might betray my true feelings. I would assert that I had no knowledge of how Cook had come to be injured, and I would express my deep sorrow over the loss, hoping to elicit sympathy from the detective. My aim would be to deflect suspicion and present myself as a loyal member of the school staff, utterly devastated by the tragic turn of events.

### Parsed Story for Actor

Means: Actor had access to a revolver that was left unattended in the studio, but he had no intention of using it.
Motive: None
Opportunity: None

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Actor was in the studio, pacing nervously as he practiced his lines for an upcoming play. He was deeply engrossed in his performance, rehearsing a particularly intense scene that involved betrayal and deception. The actor's mind was consumed with thoughts of his character's motivations, and he lost track of time, unaware of the brewing tension in the kitchen between Cook and Policeman. His anxiety about the role made him seem distracted and distant from the events unfolding around him.

When the murder occurred, Actor was still in the studio, rehearsing alone. He was so focused on his lines that he didn’t hear the commotion from the kitchen. The sound of the bowstring snapping and Cook's sudden fall went unnoticed by him, as he was lost in the world of his character. It wasn't until he finished his rehearsal and stepped out of the studio that he encountered the other characters rushing toward the kitchen, their faces pale with shock.

Afterward, Actor joined the group in the kitchen, feigning surprise at the sight of Cook's lifeless body. He was visibly shaken and struggled to maintain his composure, which only added to the suspicion surrounding him. In the chaos, he tried to help by calling for assistance, but his nervous demeanor and the fact that he had been alone in the studio made him an easy target for suspicion. He felt trapped, knowing that his odd behavior could be misinterpreted as guilt.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been rehearsing in the studio prior to the murder. I was completely absorbed in my lines and had no idea what was happening in the kitchen. I mentioned that I often lose track of time when I’m preparing for a role, and that’s why I didn’t hear anything unusual. I also pointed out that I had no motive to harm Cook; she was always kind to me, and I respected her work in the kitchen.

I tried to emphasize that I was not in the kitchen when the murder took place, which should clear me of any suspicion. I even mentioned that I had seen Policeman earlier, and I found her demeanor to be quite grumpy, as usual. I speculated that perhaps she had a motive due to her ongoing issues with Cook, but I quickly dismissed that thought, knowing it could only make me look worse. I just wanted to distance myself from any blame and focus on my innocence.

I expressed my concern that my nervousness and the fact that I was alone in the studio might make me appear suspicious. I assured Detective Detecto that I had no access to the bow and arrow, and while I did have a revolver in the studio, it was purely for my rehearsals and I had no intention of using it for anything else. I felt desperate to convince the detective of my innocence, as I feared that my secret about the play would only complicate matters further.


### Parsed Story for Lumberjack

Means: None
Motive: None
Opportunity: Lumberjack was in the hot tub area, where she was preparing for a relaxing evening after a long day of work.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Lumberjack was in the hot tub area, enjoying a moment of relaxation. She had been working hard throughout the day, chopping wood and preparing the grounds for an upcoming event at the boarding school. As she soaked in the warm water, she allowed herself to unwind, thinking about her crush on Actor and how she wished he would notice her. She was completely unaware of the brewing tension between Cook and Policeman in the kitchen.

When the murder occurred, Lumberjack was still in the hot tub, blissfully unaware of the chaos unfolding just a short distance away. The sound of the bowstring snapping and Cook's sudden fall went unheard over the bubbling water and the sounds of nature surrounding her. It wasn’t until she noticed a group of people rushing past her toward the kitchen that she began to feel a sense of unease. She quickly got out of the hot tub, wrapped herself in a towel, and followed them, her heart racing with concern.

Afterward, Lumberjack arrived at the kitchen to find the scene of horror that had unfolded. She was shocked to see Cook's lifeless body and felt a wave of panic wash over her. In her haste to help, she began to assist the others in calling for help and trying to make sense of the situation. However, her sudden appearance from the hot tub, coupled with her disheveled appearance, made her seem suspicious to the others, who were already on edge from the shocking event.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been in the hot tub area before the murder, taking a much-needed break after a long day of work. I described how I had been completely absorbed in my thoughts about Actor and how I had lost track of time while enjoying the warm water. I emphasized that I had no idea anything was happening in the kitchen until I saw everyone rushing past me, which filled me with dread.

I further clarified that I had no motive to harm Cook, as I had always found her to be a kind and charming presence in the school. I expressed my shock and horror at discovering her lifeless body, and I insisted that I would never wish harm upon anyone, especially not someone who had been so supportive of the students and staff. I mentioned that my only concern was for Actor, who I feared might be implicated due to his nervous demeanor.

Finally, I pointed out that my appearance after leaving the hot tub might have raised suspicion, but I was merely trying to help in a moment of crisis. I urged Detective Detecto to consider my innocence and the fact that I had been in a completely different location when the murder occurred. I suggested that perhaps Actor's nervousness and the tension between Cook and Policeman were more telling than my own actions.


### Parsed Story for Artist

Means: Artist had access to various art supplies, including sharp tools and paintbrushes, but no lethal weapon like the bow and arrow used in the murder.
Motive: Artist harbors a deep-seated resentment towards Cook due to her perceived favoritism and success, but this does not translate into a genuine desire to kill her. The motive is more about jealousy than a true intent to harm.
Opportunity: Artist was in the studio, painting, when the murder occurred, making her unaware of the events unfolding in the kitchen.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Artist was in her studio, surrounded by canvases and paint. She was engrossed in her work, attempting to capture the essence of the boarding school's picturesque landscape. However, her mind was clouded with thoughts of Cook's recent praise from the headmaster, which only fueled her feelings of inadequacy. Artist's frustration grew as she painted, and she found herself muttering under her breath about Cook's constant accolades, which seemed to overshadow her own artistic endeavors.

When the murder occurred, Artist remained in her studio, completely absorbed in her painting. The sounds of the bowstring snapping and Cook's fall went unnoticed as she was lost in her world of colors and brushstrokes. The studio was soundproofed, allowing her to focus on her art without distractions. It wasn't until she stepped outside to take a break that she noticed a commotion and saw the other characters rushing toward the kitchen, their expressions filled with shock and horror.

Afterward, Artist hurried to the kitchen, her heart racing with concern. Upon entering, she was met with the gruesome sight of Cook's lifeless body. Panic set in as she realized the gravity of the situation. In her haste to help, she began to assist the others in calling for help, but her disheveled appearance and the paint stains on her clothes made her seem suspicious. The combination of her frantic demeanor and the fact that she had been alone in the studio raised eyebrows among the other characters, who were already on edge from the shocking event.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been in my studio painting when the murder took place. I was completely absorbed in my work, trying to capture the beauty of the school grounds. I didn't hear anything unusual because the studio is soundproofed, allowing me to focus without distractions. I only became aware of the chaos when I stepped outside for a breath of fresh air and saw everyone rushing toward the kitchen.

I expressed my shock and horror upon discovering Cook's body. I immediately joined the others in calling for help, but I noticed that my paint-stained clothes and frantic demeanor made me appear suspicious. I tried to explain that I had been working on my art and had no idea what was happening in the kitchen. I felt trapped by the circumstances, as my innocent actions were misinterpreted by the others.

I also pointed out that Policeman had been in the kitchen with Cook just before the murder. I mentioned how grumpy and tense Policeman seemed during their conversation, which made me wonder if there was more to her relationship with Cook than met the eye. I hoped that Detective Detecto would see that my focus on my art had kept me completely unaware of the events unfolding nearby.

### Full Prose Prompt

I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

# Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

This is a mystery story in the style of a golden age classic. The story features the following elements:

Victim: Cook (a 57-year-old woman, tanned and charming, who speaks in a eloquent manner)
Killer: Policeman (a 65-year-old woman, freckled and grumpy, who speaks in a monotone manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 50-year-old man, curly-haired and stoic, who speaks in a dramatic manner)

Other Characters:
Actor (a 59-year-old man, lanky and nervous, who speaks in a drawling manner), Lumberjack (a 26-year-old woman, blonde and charming, who speaks in a booming manner), Artist (a 39-year-old woman, brunette and mean, who speaks in a squeaky manner)

It Takes Place In: Exclusive boarding school
The Crime Happened In: Kitchen
Other Locations in the Story: Studio, Hot Tub

The Murder Weapon: Bow And Arrow
Other Suspicious Items: Revolver

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Bow And Arrow in the Kitchen by Policeman, killing Cook. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: Amidst the grandeur of an exclusive boarding school, a charming cook meets a fatal end by a bow and arrow, shaking the school to its core. As Detective Detecto peels back the layers of this puzzling crime, he discovers that everyone - from a grumpy policeman to a nervous actor - has secrets to hide, and the truth is more twisted than anyone could have imagined.

Policeman's Story to the Detective: 


In my account to Detective Detecto, I would express my disbelief at the situation. I would insist that I had been in the kitchen preparing for dinner, just as I always do, when I heard a commotion outside. I would claim that I rushed to the door only to find Cook lying on the floor, an arrow protruding from her body. I would emphasize my shock and horror, painting myself as a victim of circumstance rather than a perpetrator of a crime. 

I would recount how I had been in the kitchen earlier, helping Cook with the meal, and how we had shared a few light-hearted moments. I would stress that I had no reason to harm her, as I was merely doing my job. I would mention how I had stepped away briefly to check on the supplies in the pantry, which would conveniently provide me with an alibi for the time of the murder. 

Throughout my explanation, I would maintain a monotone voice, carefully avoiding any emotional inflection that might betray my true feelings. I would assert that I had no knowledge of how Cook had come to be injured, and I would express my deep sorrow over the loss, hoping to elicit sympathy from the detective. My aim would be to deflect suspicion and present myself as a loyal member of the school staff, utterly devastated by the tragic turn of events.

Actor's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been rehearsing in the studio prior to the murder. I was completely absorbed in my lines and had no idea what was happening in the kitchen. I mentioned that I often lose track of time when I’m preparing for a role, and that’s why I didn’t hear anything unusual. I also pointed out that I had no motive to harm Cook; she was always kind to me, and I respected her work in the kitchen.

I tried to emphasize that I was not in the kitchen when the murder took place, which should clear me of any suspicion. I even mentioned that I had seen Policeman earlier, and I found her demeanor to be quite grumpy, as usual. I speculated that perhaps she had a motive due to her ongoing issues with Cook, but I quickly dismissed that thought, knowing it could only make me look worse. I just wanted to distance myself from any blame and focus on my innocence.

I expressed my concern that my nervousness and the fact that I was alone in the studio might make me appear suspicious. I assured Detective Detecto that I had no access to the bow and arrow, and while I did have a revolver in the studio, it was purely for my rehearsals and I had no intention of using it for anything else. I felt desperate to convince the detective of my innocence, as I feared that my secret about the play would only complicate matters further.


Lumberjack's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been in the hot tub area before the murder, taking a much-needed break after a long day of work. I described how I had been completely absorbed in my thoughts about Actor and how I had lost track of time while enjoying the warm water. I emphasized that I had no idea anything was happening in the kitchen until I saw everyone rushing past me, which filled me with dread.

I further clarified that I had no motive to harm Cook, as I had always found her to be a kind and charming presence in the school. I expressed my shock and horror at discovering her lifeless body, and I insisted that I would never wish harm upon anyone, especially not someone who had been so supportive of the students and staff. I mentioned that my only concern was for Actor, who I feared might be implicated due to his nervous demeanor.

Finally, I pointed out that my appearance after leaving the hot tub might have raised suspicion, but I was merely trying to help in a moment of crisis. I urged Detective Detecto to consider my innocence and the fact that I had been in a completely different location when the murder occurred. I suggested that perhaps Actor's nervousness and the tension between Cook and Policeman were more telling than my own actions.


Artist's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been in my studio painting when the murder took place. I was completely absorbed in my work, trying to capture the beauty of the school grounds. I didn't hear anything unusual because the studio is soundproofed, allowing me to focus without distractions. I only became aware of the chaos when I stepped outside for a breath of fresh air and saw everyone rushing toward the kitchen.

I expressed my shock and horror upon discovering Cook's body. I immediately joined the others in calling for help, but I noticed that my paint-stained clothes and frantic demeanor made me appear suspicious. I tried to explain that I had been working on my art and had no idea what was happening in the kitchen. I felt trapped by the circumstances, as my innocent actions were misinterpreted by the others.

I also pointed out that Policeman had been in the kitchen with Cook just before the murder. I mentioned how grumpy and tense Policeman seemed during their conversation, which made me wonder if there was more to her relationship with Cook than met the eye. I hoped that Detective Detecto would see that my focus on my art had kept me completely unaware of the events unfolding nearby.

Now, here's the outline of the story that I have. I want you to follow this outline strictly, but I want you to convert it into prose.

- Narrator:	The setting: Exclusive boarding school. The victim, Cook, lies dead on the floor in the Kitchen! They were clearly murdered with Bow And Arrow (describe blood, etc).
- Narrator:	Detective Detecto arrives at the scene of the crime. (Detecto is a 50-year-old man, curly-haired and stoic, who speaks in a dramatic manner)
- Narrator:	There are only 4 people present: Artist, Policeman, Actor, Lumberjack. No one else could possibly have been here.
- Narrator:	The detective begins to poke around and ask questions. And this is what the detective learns, from clues and from talking to the people present:
- Actor:	Actor was alone in the studio, and the timing of his rehearsal can be corroborated by the other characters who heard him practicing lines.
- Actor:	Actor protests that they are innocent.
- Actor (concealed from detective):	Actor had access to a revolver that was left unattended in the studio, but he had no intention of using it.
- Actor:	Actor had a habit of talking to himself during rehearsals, which he found helped him get into character.
- Artist:	Policeman had been in the kitchen with Cook just before the murder.
- Artist (concealed from detective):	Artist had access to various art supplies, including sharp tools and paintbrushes, but no lethal weapon like the bow and arrow used in the murder.
- Artist:	Artist protests that they are innocent.
- Artist (concealed from detective):	Artist was in the studio, painting, when the murder occurred, making her unaware of the events unfolding in the kitchen.
- Artist (concealed from detective):	Artist harbors a deep-seated resentment towards Cook due to her perceived favoritism and success, but this does not translate into a genuine desire to kill her. The motive is more about jealousy than a true intent to harm.
- Artist (concealed from detective):	Artist had access to various art supplies, including sharp tools and paintbrushes, but no lethal weapon like the bow and arrow used in the murder.
- Artist (concealed from detective):	Artist was in the studio, painting, when the murder occurred, making her unaware of the events unfolding in the kitchen.
- Artist:	While painting, Artist often hummed her favorite tunes, which helped her concentrate.
- Lumberjack (concealed from detective):	Lumberjack was in the hot tub area, where she was preparing for a relaxing evening after a long day of work.
- Lumberjack:	The hot tub's timer shows that Lumberjack had been in the water for a specific duration, making it impossible for her to have committed the murder.
- Lumberjack (concealed from detective):	Lumberjack was in the hot tub area, where she was preparing for a relaxing evening after a long day of work.
- Lumberjack:	As she soaked, she noticed a family of squirrels playing in the branches above her, which made her smile.
- Policeman:	Policeman had been waiting for the right moment to confront Cook about the headmaster's favoritism.
- Policeman:	Policeman was in the kitchen, ostensibly helping Cook prepare for the evening meal.
- Policeman (concealed from detective):	Policeman harbored deep resentment towards Cook, stemming from a long-standing rivalry over the affections of the school's headmaster. Cook, with her charm and eloquence, had always been favored by the headmaster, which left Policeman feeling overlooked and bitter. This jealousy festered over the years, culminating in a desire to eliminate Cook from the equation entirely.
- Policeman (concealed from detective):	The murder was committed using a bow and arrow, a weapon Policeman had access to due to her involvement in the school's archery club. The bow and arrow were typically stored in the gymnasium, but Policeman had taken them to the kitchen under the pretense of practicing her aim during a quiet moment.
- Policeman (concealed from detective):	Cook was vulnerable during the late afternoon when she was preparing dinner for the students. The kitchen was bustling with activity, but at that moment, Cook had stepped outside to gather fresh herbs from the garden, leaving her momentarily alone and unguarded. Policeman seized this opportunity to confront Cook and ultimately carry out her deadly plan.
- Policeman:	The kitchen window was slightly ajar, letting in a pleasant breeze that carried the scent of blooming flowers from the garden.
- Policeman:	Policeman protests that they are innocent.
- Actor:	Actor was visibly shaken and struggled to maintain his composure, which added to the suspicion surrounding him.
- Actor:	Actor joined the group in the kitchen, feigning surprise at the sight of Cook's lifeless body.
- Artist:	Artist's frantic demeanor raised eyebrows among the other characters, who were already on edge from the shocking event.
- Artist:	Other characters, including Lumberjack, can confirm that Artist was alone in the studio and did not leave until after the murder had occurred.
- Lumberjack:	I suggested that perhaps Actor's nervousness and the tension between Cook and Policeman were more telling.
- Lumberjack:	Lumberjack protests that they are innocent.
- Lumberjack:	My appearance after leaving the hot tub might have raised suspicion.
- Lumberjack:	Lumberjack's sudden appearance from the hot tub, coupled with her disheveled appearance, made her seem suspicious to the others.
- Lumberjack:	After the chaos, Lumberjack realized she had forgotten to bring her favorite towel, which was still hanging in her cabin.
- Narrator:	It must be one of these suspects, and Detecto knows just who it is.

# Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point.

### Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the exclusive boarding school, his curly hair catching the light as he surveyed the grim scene before him: the charming Cook lay dead on the kitchen floor, an arrow protruding from her chest, blood pooling beneath her. Only four people were present: the Artist, the Policeman, the Actor, and the Lumberjack, and it was clear that no one else could have been involved. As Detecto began his investigation, he knew that the truth lay hidden among these individuals, each with their own secrets and stories.

The Actor, a lanky and nervous man, claimed he had been alone in the studio, rehearsing his lines, a fact corroborated by the others who had heard his drawling voice echoing through the halls. Despite his protests of innocence, Detecto noted the Actor's concealed access to a revolver left unattended in the studio, though the Actor insisted it was merely a prop for his rehearsals. The Actor's habit of talking to himself during rehearsals was well-known, a method he used to immerse himself in his roles.

The Artist, with her squeaky voice, pointed out that the Policeman had been in the kitchen with Cook just before the murder, a fact that piqued Detecto's interest. Although the Artist protested her innocence, Detecto discerned her concealed resentment towards Cook, stemming from jealousy rather than a true intent to harm. The Artist had been in her studio, painting, unaware of the events in the kitchen, and her humming while she worked was a testament to her focus on her art.

The Lumberjack, a blonde and charming woman, explained that she had been in the hot tub area, relaxing after a long day, and the timer on the hot tub confirmed her alibi. Detecto noticed her concealed concern for the Actor, fearing his nervous demeanor might implicate him, but her own innocence was supported by the duration of her soak. As she soaked, she had been distracted by a family of squirrels, a detail that added to her alibi.

The Policeman, freckled and grumpy, had been in the kitchen ostensibly helping Cook prepare for the evening meal, but Detecto sensed a deeper resentment towards Cook, rooted in a rivalry over the headmaster's favoritism. The murder weapon, a bow and arrow, was linked to the Policeman's involvement in the school's archery club, a fact she had concealed but which Detecto uncovered through her familiarity with the weapon. The kitchen window had been slightly ajar, allowing a breeze to carry the scent of flowers, a detail that seemed innocuous but hinted at the Policeman's opportunity to strike.

The Actor, visibly shaken, struggled to maintain his composure, adding to the suspicion surrounding him as he joined the group in the kitchen, feigning surprise at Cook's lifeless body. The Artist's frantic demeanor raised eyebrows, but other characters, including the Lumberjack, confirmed her presence in the studio during the murder. The Lumberjack suggested that perhaps the Actor's nervousness and the tension between Cook and the Policeman were more telling than her own actions, though she protested her innocence.

Detecto observed the Lumberjack's sudden appearance from the hot tub, her disheveled look making her seem suspicious, but her alibi held firm. After the chaos, she realized she had forgotten her favorite towel, a small detail that seemed irrelevant but added to the picture of her innocence. As Detecto pieced together the evidence, he knew that one of these suspects was the murderer, and he was confident he had unraveled the mystery.
