# Hammer in the Rainstorm

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the Gothic castle perched on a cliff, the rainstorm lashing against its ancient stones, and made his way to the cottage where the young chauffeur lay dead on the floor, clearly murdered with a hammer, the scene gruesome with blood spattered across the wooden floorboards. As he surveyed the crime scene, Detecto noted the presence of only four potential suspects: the Accountant, the Teacher, the Cook, and the Farmer, each with their own peculiarities and alibis. 

Detecto began his investigation by questioning the Accountant, who was visibly anxious, his mind seemingly elsewhere. "I was in the main hall with the other guests," the Accountant mumbled, his eyes darting nervously, "engaged in conversation when the murder occurred." Detecto sensed the Accountant's preoccupation with something deeper, perhaps his mounting gambling debts, which seemed to weigh heavily on his conscience. Despite his nervous demeanor, Detecto discerned that the Accountant had access to the hammer in the toolbox, yet there was no indication he had used it.

Next, Detecto turned his attention to the Cook, who was busy in the kitchen, hands covered in flour and food residue. "I was preparing dinner," the Cook recounted, "completely unaware of the events in the cottage." As the Cook shared a humorous anecdote about mistaking salt for sugar in a dessert, Detecto observed the Cook's access to kitchen knives but noted the absence of any weapon that could be linked to the murder.

The Farmer, a stout and nervous man, protested his innocence when questioned. "I was in the castle's kitchen, preparing food for the evening," he insisted, his voice articulate yet tinged with anxiety. Detecto noted the Farmer's access to a shovel from the garden shed, which could be misconstrued as a weapon, but the state of the kitchen, with pots still simmering and ingredients laid out, indicated the Farmer had no time to commit the murder.

Finally, Detecto spoke with the Teacher, who had made his way to the cottage where the Chauffeur was preparing. "When I arrived, he was singing away, completely engrossed in his work," the Teacher explained, his terse manner betraying little emotion. Detecto's keen eye caught the Teacher's subtle unease, and he deduced that the Teacher felt threatened by the Chauffeur's growing influence and feared exposure of his questionable methods, providing a motive for the crime.

As Detecto pieced together the evidence, he recalled the Teacher's admiration for a beautiful tapestry depicting local folklore, a detail that seemed oddly out of place amidst the tension of the evening. Meanwhile, the Accountant complimented the delicious aroma of the roast being prepared, trying to act normal despite his fidgeting and mumbling, which only heightened Detecto's suspicions. The Cook, feeling trapped by Detecto's presence, struggled to maintain composure, their darting glances and fidgeting making them appear suspicious. Similarly, the Farmer's nervous demeanor and mismatched dish towels added an element of eccentricity to his character, yet Detecto remained focused on the facts.

Detecto's investigation led him to conclude that one of these suspects was indeed the murderer, and as he prepared to reveal his findings, he knew exactly who it was.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Chauffeur?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Cook
- B: Teacher
- C: Accountant
- D: Farmer

## Correct Answer

The killer is Teacher

## Reasoning

- [DURING_CRIME]	The state of the kitchen shows that Farmer was actively engaged in cooking, with pots still simmering and ingredients laid out, indicating he had no time to commit the murder. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Farmer)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	I assure you, I had nothing to do with it. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Accountant)
- [DURING_CRIME]	Cook's hands are covered in flour and food residue, indicating they were actively cooking and could not have committed the murder. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Cook)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Teacher wanted Chauffeur dead because he felt threatened by the young man's growing influence over the other staff and the potential for Chauffeur to expose Teacher's questionable methods of teaching and personal conduct. Teacher believed that eliminating Chauffeur would restore his authority and control over the castle's staff. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Teacher)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a hammer, which was readily available in the cottage where the Chauffeur was found. The hammer was typically used for maintenance work around the castle, making it an unassuming weapon. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Teacher)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Chauffeur was vulnerable to attack when he was alone in the cottage, preparing for the evening's events. The storm outside created a loud backdrop, masking any sounds of struggle or distress, allowing Teacher to approach without being heard. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Teacher)
