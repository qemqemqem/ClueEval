# Isle of Shadows: A Candlestick Murder

## Full Story

The remote island resort, usually a haven of tranquility, was now a scene of grim discovery as I, Detective Detecto, arrived at the auditorium where the lifeless body of the young priest lay, a candlestick ominously nearby, stained with the evidence of its deadly use. As I surveyed the scene, the stark reality of the murder was undeniable, and I knew I had to unravel the mystery with the four individuals present: the Guard, the Artist, the Sailor, and the Lawyer.

I began my inquiry with the Artist, who, despite her protests of innocence, seemed to carry a shadow of unease. "I was merely attending the rehearsal," she claimed, her voice monotone, yet I couldn't help but notice her eyes darting towards the candlestick, as if it held a secret only she knew. The Guard, a tall and energetic woman, mentioned, "I noticed the Artist lurking around the auditorium before the rehearsal," her articulate manner leaving little room for doubt about her observations.

As I continued, the Guard's story revealed more than she intended; her sudden absence from the auditorium during the critical moment was a thread I couldn't ignore. "I stepped out to check on the guests in the garden," she explained, but the timing of her departure was suspiciously convenient, and I noted her familiarity with the candlestick's location. The Lawyer, stoic and terse, insisted, "I was in the mansion, absorbed in my documents," yet his tension with the Priest was palpable, a fact he couldn't entirely conceal.

The Sailor, with her verbose manner, recounted, "I was in the garden, tending to my plants," her hands still bearing traces of soil, which she claimed was from her gardening. Her nervousness was evident, and the dirt on her hands seemed to tell a story of its own, though she maintained her innocence. The Artist, meanwhile, mentioned the distant cry of a seagull during the rehearsal, a detail that seemed oddly out of place, yet perhaps significant.

As I pieced together the narratives, the Guard's recollection of the candlestick's untouched position on the table was intriguing, suggesting a deliberate attempt to restore order after chaos. The Lawyer's stoic demeanor, while not incriminating, did little to endear him to the other guests, who eyed him with suspicion. Sailor's humming of a sea shanty, a habit she claimed helped her plants grow, seemed an innocent quirk, yet her nervousness was hard to dismiss.

Each character's story was a puzzle piece, and as I listened, I could sense the truth lurking beneath their words. The Guard's protestations of innocence were earnest, yet her sudden departure from the auditorium was a thread I couldn't ignore. The Lawyer's focus on his documents seemed genuine, yet his previous disagreements with the Priest lingered in my mind. Sailor's innocence was marred by her nervous demeanor, and the Artist's protestations were overshadowed by her earlier tension with the Priest.

As I stood amidst the assembled characters, the weight of the evidence began to coalesce into a coherent picture. I knew the truth was within reach, and with one final revelation, the identity of the murderer would be laid bare.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Priest?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Guard
- B: Lawyer
- C: Sailor
- D: Artist

## Correct Answer

The killer is Artist

## Reasoning

- [DURING_CRIME]	When the murder occurred, Sailor was still in the garden, completely unaware of the events unfolding in the auditorium. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Sailor)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	The candlestick was found in its original position on the table, indicating it was not moved or tampered with by the guard. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Guard)
- [DURING_CRIME]	I was completely absorbed in my task and did not hear any commotion from the auditorium. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Lawyer)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Artist felt overshadowed by Priest's charm and popularity. She believed that Priest's presence stifled her creativity and drew attention away from her work, leading to feelings of jealousy and resentment. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Artist)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a candlestick, which was readily available in the auditorium where the two women often interacted. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Artist)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Priest was vulnerable during a late-night rehearsal for a charity event, when the auditorium was empty and the atmosphere was tense, allowing Artist to approach without being noticed. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Artist)
