# Scissors in the Shadows

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the exclusive members-only club, her gravelly voice cutting through the tension as she surveyed the scene of the crime. The victim, Shopkeeper, lay dead on the floor of the house, a pair of scissors protruding from his chest, surrounded by a pool of blood. Only four people were present: Lawyer, Teacher, Journalist, and Doctor, and no one else could possibly have been there. Detecto began her investigation, questioning each suspect and piecing together the events of the evening.

Doctor, with her elegant demeanor, insisted she had been in the drawing room, engaged in conversation, when the murder occurred, making it impossible for her to have attacked Shopkeeper. The drawing room was adorned with vintage medical posters, which Doctor found amusing, a detail she shared with a hint of nostalgia. Despite her protests of innocence, Detecto noted the Doctor's access to various medical instruments, including a scalpel, though she claimed no intention of using them for harm. Witnesses in the drawing room confirmed Doctor's presence during the time of the murder, providing her with an alibi.

Journalist, articulate and awkward, recounted his interest in the club's finances for an expos√©, claiming he was completely unaware of the murder taking place in the cellar. He recalled a humorous incident of spilling ink on his shirt during an important interview, a story that seemed to lighten the mood momentarily. As he took notes, Journalist admired the intricate woodwork on the furniture, a testament to the club's opulence. Despite his protests of innocence, Detecto observed his access to a notepad and pen, which could be misconstrued as tools for planning or documenting the murder. Journalist failed to hear any commotion from the cellar, making it unlikely he was involved in the crime.

Lawyer, with a gravelly voice matching Detecto's own, suggested that perhaps Teacher, who had been acting strangely, might have had a reason to confront Shopkeeper. Animatedly gesturing with a pair of scissors she had been using to cut through legal documents, Lawyer insisted on her innocence. Detecto noticed Lawyer's habit of twirling her hair when deep in thought, a nervous tic that betrayed her anxiety. Despite her protests, Detecto noted Lawyer's access to the scissors, which she used for cutting paper, though witnesses confirmed her presence in the drawing room during the murder.

Teacher, enthusiastic yet harboring a hidden resentment, protested his innocence with fervor. Detecto's keen eye caught the subtle signs of Teacher's deep-seated envy towards Shopkeeper, a rivalry that had festered over the years. The murder weapon, a pair of scissors, had been taken from the club's drawing room, a fact Teacher tried to conceal but failed to hide from Detecto's scrutiny. Shopkeeper had been vulnerable in the cellar, retrieving a bottle of wine, when Teacher seized the opportunity to confront him under the guise of camaraderie. Teacher's quick composure after the murder, wiping the scissors clean and placing them back on a nearby shelf, did not escape Detecto's notice.

As Detecto pieced together the puzzle, she refrained from passing judgment, instead revealing the clues to the reader with a practiced neutrality. The evidence pointed to one of the suspects, and Detecto knew just who it was, but she held her conclusion, leaving the revelation hanging in the air.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Shopkeeper?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Lawyer
- B: Doctor
- C: Journalist
- D: Teacher

## Correct Answer

The killer is Teacher

## Reasoning

- [DURING_CRIME]	I had been in the drawing room the entire evening, engaged in discussions with other members about legal matters. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Lawyer)
- [DURING_CRIME]	Witnesses in the drawing room can confirm Doctor's presence during the time of the murder, providing her with an alibi. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Doctor)
- [DURING_CRIME]	Journalist failed to hear any commotion coming from the cellar, making it impossible for him to have been involved in the crime. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Journalist)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Teacher harbored deep resentment towards Shopkeeper due to a long-standing rivalry. Shopkeeper had once been a successful entrepreneur, while Teacher struggled to make ends meet. Over the years, Shopkeeper's charm and success had overshadowed Teacher's achievements, leading to feelings of inadequacy and envy. When Shopkeeper began to openly mock Teacher's financial struggles during a recent club gathering, it pushed Teacher over the edge, igniting a desire for revenge. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Teacher)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a pair of scissors, which Teacher had taken from the club's drawing room. The scissors were sharp and easily accessible, making them an ideal weapon for a crime of passion. Teacher had planned the attack in a moment of rage, seizing the opportunity to use an item that could be easily concealed and discarded. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Teacher)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Shopkeeper was vulnerable to attack during a quiet moment in the club's cellar, where he had gone to retrieve a bottle of wine for a gathering. The cellar was dimly lit and isolated, providing the perfect setting for Teacher to confront Shopkeeper without drawing attention. With the other club members occupied in the drawing room, Shopkeeper was alone and unsuspecting, making it easy for Teacher to approach him under the guise of camaraderie. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Teacher)

### Speaker: Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a pair of scissors, which Teacher had taken from the club's drawing room. The scissors were sharp and easily accessible, making them an ideal weapon for a crime of passion. Teacher had planned the attack in a moment of rage, seizing the opportunity to use an item that could be easily concealed and discarded.
Motive: Teacher harbored deep resentment towards Shopkeeper due to a long-standing rivalry. Shopkeeper had once been a successful entrepreneur, while Teacher struggled to make ends meet. Over the years, Shopkeeper's charm and success had overshadowed Teacher's achievements, leading to feelings of inadequacy and envy. When Shopkeeper began to openly mock Teacher's financial struggles during a recent club gathering, it pushed Teacher over the edge, igniting a desire for revenge.
Opportunity: Shopkeeper was vulnerable to attack during a quiet moment in the club's cellar, where he had gone to retrieve a bottle of wine for a gathering. The cellar was dimly lit and isolated, providing the perfect setting for Teacher to confront Shopkeeper without drawing attention. With the other club members occupied in the drawing room, Shopkeeper was alone and unsuspecting, making it easy for Teacher to approach him under the guise of camaraderie.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Teacher and Shopkeeper were both attending a gathering at the exclusive members-only club. The atmosphere was lively, with members engaged in conversation and laughter. However, tension simmered beneath the surface as Teacher overheard Shopkeeper making disparaging remarks about his financial situation to another member. Feeling humiliated and angry, Teacher decided to confront Shopkeeper, but he needed to wait for the right moment to act.

The murder occurred in the cellar, where Shopkeeper had gone to fetch a bottle of wine. As he rummaged through the shelves, Teacher entered the dimly lit space, feigning friendliness. When Shopkeeper turned to greet him, Teacher seized the opportunity, brandishing the scissors he had concealed in his jacket. In a sudden burst of rage, Teacher lunged at Shopkeeper, stabbing him with the scissors in a fit of anger. The attack was swift and brutal, leaving Shopkeeper no chance to defend himself.

After the murder, Teacher quickly composed himself, wiping the scissors clean and placing them back on a nearby shelf. He then exited the cellar, rejoining the other club members in the drawing room, acting as if nothing had happened. As the evening progressed, Teacher maintained his fa√ßade of enthusiasm, even as the tension in the air grew thicker with the absence of Shopkeeper. He was careful to avoid drawing suspicion, all the while knowing that he had just committed an unforgivable act.


Story to Detective: 


In my account to Detective Detecto, I would explain that I had no reason to harm Shopkeeper. We were both members of the club, and I believed we shared a mutual respect, or at least I thought so. I had been in the drawing room, enjoying the company of other members, when I noticed Shopkeeper had stepped away. I assumed he was simply taking a break, as we all do from time to time. I even thought about joining him to share a laugh about the evening's events, as I had no ill will toward him.

When I entered the cellar, I was surprised to find it empty. I was merely looking for a quiet moment to gather my thoughts. I had heard some commotion earlier, but I didn't think much of it. I remember seeing the scissors on the shelf, but I thought nothing of them. They were just a tool, after all. I was focused on the gathering and the camaraderie we all shared. I had no idea that Shopkeeper was in there, nor did I have any intention of confronting him.

I understand that my presence in the cellar might raise questions, but I assure you, I was simply there by chance. I left the cellar and returned to the drawing room, where I engaged with the other members, laughing and enjoying the evening. I would never harm anyone, especially not a fellow member of our esteemed club. I believe there must be some misunderstanding, and I am more than willing to assist in any way to clear my name.

### Speaker: Parsed Story for Lawyer

Means: Lawyer had access to a set of legal documents that included a pair of scissors, which she used for cutting paper.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Lawyer was in the drawing room when the murder occurred, making it impossible for her to have attacked Shopkeeper in the cellar.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Lawyer was engaged in a conversation with several club members in the drawing room, discussing the latest legal reforms and their implications for the club's operations. She was animatedly gesturing with a pair of scissors she had been using to cut through some legal documents, which she had brought along to illustrate her points. Her laughter and enthusiasm masked the underlying tension she felt about her financial situation, as she was acutely aware of the judgmental eyes of her peers.

When the murder occurred, Lawyer remained in the drawing room, oblivious to the dark events unfolding in the cellar. She was engrossed in a debate with another member about the merits of a recent court case, and the lively atmosphere of the gathering distracted her from noticing Shopkeeper's absence. The sound of laughter and clinking glasses filled the air, creating a stark contrast to the grim reality of the crime taking place just a few feet away.

After the murder, Lawyer continued to engage with the other members, but her demeanor shifted slightly as she sensed the growing unease in the room. When the news of Shopkeeper's death broke, she feigned shock and concern, but her mind raced with thoughts of her own precarious financial situation. As the investigation began, she found herself increasingly anxious, aware that her earlier use of scissors might draw unwanted attention to her, despite her innocence in the matter.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been in the drawing room the entire evening, engaged in discussions with other members about legal matters. I had brought some documents with me, and I was using a pair of scissors to illustrate my points. I was completely unaware of what was happening in the cellar, as the atmosphere was so lively and distracting. I couldn't have possibly committed the murder because I was surrounded by others who can vouch for my whereabouts.

I expressed my concern about the implications of the murder on the club and how it might affect our reputation. I mentioned that I had no motive to harm Shopkeeper, as I had always found him to be a charming and likable man. I even suggested that perhaps Teacher, who had been acting strangely, might have had a reason to confront Shopkeeper, given the tension I had overheard between them earlier in the evening.

I also pointed out that my financial troubles were a personal matter and had nothing to do with Shopkeeper. I was simply trying to maintain my dignity in front of the other members, and I hoped that my innocence would be established once the truth came to light. I felt it was important to emphasize that I had no opportunity to commit the crime, as I was in the drawing room the entire time.


### Speaker: Parsed Story for Doctor

Means: Doctor had access to various medical instruments, including a scalpel, but she had no intention of using them for harm.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Doctor was in the drawing room, engaged in conversation with other members, when the murder occurred, making it impossible for her to attack Shopkeeper.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Doctor was mingling in the drawing room, discussing the latest advancements in medical science with a small group of club members. She was animated and engaged, using her elegant demeanor to charm those around her. However, beneath her polished exterior, she was preoccupied with thoughts of Shopkeeper's recent health issues, which he had confided in her during a private consultation. She felt a sense of responsibility for his well-being and was worried about the implications of his condition becoming public knowledge.

When the murder occurred, Doctor remained in the drawing room, completely unaware of the dark events unfolding in the cellar. She was engrossed in a lively debate about the ethics of medical practices, her attention focused on the conversation and the laughter of her peers. The atmosphere was light and jovial, which further distracted her from noticing Shopkeeper's absence. The sounds of clinking glasses and animated discussions drowned out any noise that might have indicated trouble in the cellar.

After the murder, Doctor's demeanor shifted as she sensed the growing tension in the room. When the news of Shopkeeper's death broke, she feigned shock and concern, but her mind raced with thoughts of how his death might affect her practice. She quickly excused herself from the group, claiming she needed to check on her medical supplies in the cellar, hoping to gather her thoughts and assess the situation. As she descended the stairs, she felt a mix of anxiety and dread, knowing that her connection to Shopkeeper could make her a target of suspicion.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been in the drawing room the entire evening, engaged in discussions about medical ethics with fellow club members. I had no idea that anything was amiss until the news of Shopkeeper's death reached us. I was genuinely shocked and concerned, as I had been treating him for a serious health condition, which he had confided in me. I felt a sense of responsibility for his well-being, and the thought of his death weighed heavily on me.

I emphasized that I had no motive to harm Shopkeeper. Our relationship was professional, and I had always sought to help him with his health issues. I was aware of the financial difficulties he faced, but I had no reason to believe he would be in danger from anyone, least of all from me. The idea that I could be implicated in his murder was absurd, and I wanted to make it clear that I had no ill will towards him.

I also pointed out that I had been in the drawing room when the murder took place, surrounded by other members who could vouch for my whereabouts. I had no opportunity to commit the crime, and I was genuinely concerned about how this tragedy would affect my practice. I suggested that perhaps Teacher, who had been overheard arguing with Shopkeeper earlier, might be worth investigating further.


### Speaker: Parsed Story for Journalist

Means: Journalist had access to a notepad and pen, which could be misconstrued as tools for planning or documenting the murder.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Journalist was in the drawing room, engaged in conversation with other members, completely unaware of the murder taking place in the cellar.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Journalist was mingling in the drawing room, taking notes on the conversations and interactions among the club members. He was particularly interested in the discussions surrounding the club's finances, as he had been gathering information for an expos√© that would reveal the club's questionable practices. While he appeared engaged and animated, he was also careful to maintain a low profile, aware that his presence could raise suspicions among the members who were unaware of his true intentions.

When the murder occurred, Journalist remained in the drawing room, engrossed in a debate about the merits of a recent political scandal with a group of club members. The lively atmosphere, filled with laughter and clinking glasses, distracted him from noticing Shopkeeper's absence. He was so focused on his notes and the conversation that he failed to hear any commotion coming from the cellar, making it impossible for him to have been involved in the crime.

After the murder, Journalist continued to engage with the other members, but he sensed a shift in the atmosphere as the news of Shopkeeper's death began to circulate. He quickly excused himself from the group, claiming he needed to gather his thoughts for an article he was writing. As he retreated to a quieter corner of the drawing room, he felt a growing sense of dread, knowing that his secretive intentions could easily be misconstrued as suspicious behavior in the wake of the murder.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been in the drawing room before the murder, taking notes on the conversations among the club members. I was particularly focused on the discussions surrounding the club's financial practices, as I was working on an expos√© that I believed would shed light on some troubling issues within the organization. I emphasized that my intentions were purely journalistic and that I had no motive to harm Shopkeeper, who was simply a subject of my research.

When the murder occurred, I remained in the drawing room, completely unaware of the events unfolding in the cellar. I was engaged in a lively debate with several members, and the atmosphere was so jovial that I didn't notice Shopkeeper's absence until the news broke. I expressed my shock and concern, but I was also acutely aware that my note-taking could be perceived as suspicious, especially given the circumstances.

After the murder, I excused myself from the group to gather my thoughts and ensure that my notes were secure. I felt a growing sense of anxiety as I realized how easily my actions could be misinterpreted. I wanted to assure Detective Detecto that I had no involvement in the crime and that my focus had always been on uncovering the truth about the club, not causing harm to any of its members.

# Notes

Killer: Teacher (a 49-year-old man, average height and mean, who speaks in a enthusiastic manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 67-year-old woman, fat and awkward, who speaks in a gravelly manner)

It Takes Place In: Exclusive members-only club
The Crime Happened In: House
Other Locations in the Story: Drawing Room, Cellar

The Murder Weapon: Scissors
Other Suspicious Items: Crossbow

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Scissors in the House by Teacher, killing Shopkeeper. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In the closed confines of an exclusive members-only club, a charming shopkeeper is found dead, murdered with a pair of scissors. Detective Detecto, with her gravelly voice and unwavering determination, navigates through a web of secrets and lies to unmask the killer: a seemingly enthusiastic teacher. With a crossbow adding an unexpected twist, the game of cat and mouse intensifies in this thrilling golden age mystery.

Teacher's Story to the Detective: 


In my account to Detective Detecto, I would explain that I had no reason to harm Shopkeeper. We were both members of the club, and I believed we shared a mutual respect, or at least I thought so. I had been in the drawing room, enjoying the company of other members, when I noticed Shopkeeper had stepped away. I assumed he was simply taking a break, as we all do from time to time. I even thought about joining him to share a laugh about the evening's events, as I had no ill will toward him.

When I entered the cellar, I was surprised to find it empty. I was merely looking for a quiet moment to gather my thoughts. I had heard some commotion earlier, but I didn't think much of it. I remember seeing the scissors on the shelf, but I thought nothing of them. They were just a tool, after all. I was focused on the gathering and the camaraderie we all shared. I had no idea that Shopkeeper was in there, nor did I have any intention of confronting him.

I understand that my presence in the cellar might raise questions, but I assure you, I was simply there by chance. I left the cellar and returned to the drawing room, where I engaged with the other members, laughing and enjoying the evening. I would never harm anyone, especially not a fellow member of our esteemed club. I believe there must be some misunderstanding, and I am more than willing to assist in any way to clear my name.

Lawyer's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been in the drawing room the entire evening, engaged in discussions with other members about legal matters. I had brought some documents with me, and I was using a pair of scissors to illustrate my points. I was completely unaware of what was happening in the cellar, as the atmosphere was so lively and distracting. I couldn't have possibly committed the murder because I was surrounded by others who can vouch for my whereabouts.

I expressed my concern about the implications of the murder on the club and how it might affect our reputation. I mentioned that I had no motive to harm Shopkeeper, as I had always found him to be a charming and likable man. I even suggested that perhaps Teacher, who had been acting strangely, might have had a reason to confront Shopkeeper, given the tension I had overheard between them earlier in the evening.

I also pointed out that my financial troubles were a personal matter and had nothing to do with Shopkeeper. I was simply trying to maintain my dignity in front of the other members, and I hoped that my innocence would be established once the truth came to light. I felt it was important to emphasize that I had no opportunity to commit the crime, as I was in the drawing room the entire time.


Doctor's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been in the drawing room the entire evening, engaged in discussions about medical ethics with fellow club members. I had no idea that anything was amiss until the news of Shopkeeper's death reached us. I was genuinely shocked and concerned, as I had been treating him for a serious health condition, which he had confided in me. I felt a sense of responsibility for his well-being, and the thought of his death weighed heavily on me.

I emphasized that I had no motive to harm Shopkeeper. Our relationship was professional, and I had always sought to help him with his health issues. I was aware of the financial difficulties he faced, but I had no reason to believe he would be in danger from anyone, least of all from me. The idea that I could be implicated in his murder was absurd, and I wanted to make it clear that I had no ill will towards him.

I also pointed out that I had been in the drawing room when the murder took place, surrounded by other members who could vouch for my whereabouts. I had no opportunity to commit the crime, and I was genuinely concerned about how this tragedy would affect my practice. I suggested that perhaps Teacher, who had been overheard arguing with Shopkeeper earlier, might be worth investigating further.


Journalist's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been in the drawing room before the murder, taking notes on the conversations among the club members. I was particularly focused on the discussions surrounding the club's financial practices, as I was working on an expos√© that I believed would shed light on some troubling issues within the organization. I emphasized that my intentions were purely journalistic and that I had no motive to harm Shopkeeper, who was simply a subject of my research.

When the murder occurred, I remained in the drawing room, completely unaware of the events unfolding in the cellar. I was engaged in a lively debate with several members, and the atmosphere was so jovial that I didn't notice Shopkeeper's absence until the news broke. I expressed my shock and concern, but I was also acutely aware that my note-taking could be perceived as suspicious, especially given the circumstances.

After the murder, I excused myself from the group to gather my thoughts and ensure that my notes were secure. I felt a growing sense of anxiety as I realized how easily my actions could be misinterpreted. I wanted to assure Detective Detecto that I had no involvement in the crime and that my focus had always been on uncovering the truth about the club, not causing harm to any of its members.

# Outline

Now, here's the outline of the story that I have. I want you to follow this outline strictly, but I want you to convert it into prose.

- Narrator:	The setting: Exclusive members-only club. The victim, Shopkeeper, lies dead on the floor in the House! They were clearly murdered with Scissors (describe blood, etc).
- Narrator:	Detective Detecto arrives at the scene of the crime. (Detecto is a 67-year-old woman, fat and awkward, who speaks in a gravelly manner)
- Narrator:	There are only 4 people present: Lawyer, Teacher, Journalist, Doctor. No one else could possibly have been here.
- Narrator:	The detective begins to poke around and ask questions. And this is what the detective learns, from clues and from talking to the people present:
- Doctor (concealed from detective):	Doctor had access to various medical instruments, including a scalpel, but she had no intention of using them for harm.
- Doctor (concealed from detective):	Doctor was in the drawing room, engaged in conversation with other members, when the murder occurred, making it impossible for her to attack Shopkeeper.
- Doctor:	The drawing room was decorated with an assortment of vintage medical posters, which Doctor found amusing.
- Doctor:	Doctor protests that they are innocent.

- Journalist (concealed from detective):	Journalist was in the drawing room, engaged in conversation with other members, completely unaware of the murder taking place in the cellar.
- Journalist:	He recalled a time when he accidentally spilled ink on his shirt during an important interview, leading to a humorous exchange with the interviewee.
- Journalist:	As he took notes, Journalist couldn't help but admire the intricate woodwork on the furniture, which he thought must have been crafted by a skilled artisan.
- Lawyer:	I suggested that perhaps Teacher, who had been acting strangely, might have had a reason to confront Shopkeeper.
- Lawyer:	Lawyer protests that they are innocent.
- Lawyer (concealed from detective):	Lawyer had access to a set of legal documents that included a pair of scissors, which she used for cutting paper.
- Lawyer:	Lawyer was animatedly gesturing with a pair of scissors she had been using to cut through some legal documents.
- Lawyer (concealed from detective):	Lawyer had access to a set of legal documents that included a pair of scissors, which she used for cutting paper.
- Lawyer (concealed from detective):	Lawyer was in the drawing room when the murder occurred, making it impossible for her to have attacked Shopkeeper in the cellar.
- Lawyer:	Lawyer had a habit of twirling her hair when she was deep in thought, which she did frequently during the discussion.

- Teacher (concealed from detective):	Shopkeeper was vulnerable to attack during a quiet moment in the club's cellar, where he had gone to retrieve a bottle of wine for a gathering. The cellar was dimly lit and isolated, providing the perfect setting for Teacher to confront Shopkeeper without drawing attention. With the other club members occupied in the drawing room, Shopkeeper was alone and unsuspecting, making it easy for Teacher to approach him under the guise of camaraderie.
- Doctor:	Witnesses in the drawing room can confirm Doctor's presence during the time of the murder, providing her with an alibi.

- Narrator:	It must be one of these suspects, and Detecto knows just who it is.

# Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point.

### Speaker: Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the exclusive members-only club, her gravelly voice cutting through the tension as she surveyed the scene of the crime. The victim, Shopkeeper, lay dead on the floor of the house, a pair of scissors protruding from his chest, surrounded by a pool of blood. Only four people were present: Lawyer, Teacher, Journalist, and Doctor, and no one else could possibly have been there. Detecto began her investigation, questioning each suspect and piecing together the events of the evening.

Doctor, with her elegant demeanor, insisted she had been in the drawing room, engaged in conversation, when the murder occurred, making it impossible for her to have attacked Shopkeeper. The drawing room was adorned with vintage medical posters, which Doctor found amusing, a detail she shared with a hint of nostalgia. Despite her protests of innocence, Detecto noted the Doctor's access to various medical instruments, including a scalpel, though she claimed no intention of using them for harm. Witnesses in the drawing room confirmed Doctor's presence during the time of the murder, providing her with an alibi.

Journalist, articulate and awkward, recounted his interest in the club's finances for an expos√©, claiming he was completely unaware of the murder taking place in the cellar. He recalled a humorous incident of spilling ink on his shirt during an important interview, a story that seemed to lighten the mood momentarily. As he took notes, Journalist admired the intricate woodwork on the furniture, a testament to the club's opulence. Despite his protests of innocence, Detecto observed his access to a notepad and pen, which could be misconstrued as tools for planning or documenting the murder. Journalist failed to hear any commotion from the cellar, making it unlikely he was involved in the crime.

Lawyer, with a gravelly voice matching Detecto's own, suggested that perhaps Teacher, who had been acting strangely, might have had a reason to confront Shopkeeper. Animatedly gesturing with a pair of scissors she had been using to cut through legal documents, Lawyer insisted on her innocence. Detecto noticed Lawyer's habit of twirling her hair when deep in thought, a nervous tic that betrayed her anxiety. Despite her protests, Detecto noted Lawyer's access to the scissors, which she used for cutting paper, though witnesses confirmed her presence in the drawing room during the murder.

Teacher, enthusiastic yet harboring a hidden resentment, protested his innocence with fervor. Detecto's keen eye caught the subtle signs of Teacher's deep-seated envy towards Shopkeeper, a rivalry that had festered over the years. The murder weapon, a pair of scissors, had been taken from the club's drawing room, a fact Teacher tried to conceal but failed to hide from Detecto's scrutiny. Shopkeeper had been vulnerable in the cellar, retrieving a bottle of wine, when Teacher seized the opportunity to confront him under the guise of camaraderie. Teacher's quick composure after the murder, wiping the scissors clean and placing them back on a nearby shelf, did not escape Detecto's notice.

As Detecto pieced together the puzzle, she refrained from passing judgment, instead revealing the clues to the reader with a practiced neutrality. The evidence pointed to one of the suspects, and Detecto knew just who it was, but she held her conclusion, leaving the revelation hanging in the air.
