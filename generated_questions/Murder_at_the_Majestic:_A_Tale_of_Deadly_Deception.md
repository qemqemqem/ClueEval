# Murder at the Majestic: A Tale of Deadly Deception

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the grand yet remote Majestic Hotel, her lanky frame casting a shadow over the scene of the crime where the dignified Gardener lay dead on the floor of the hall, clearly murdered with a trophy, its sharp edges stained with blood. As she surveyed the room, her monotone voice cut through the tension, noting that only four people were present: Nurse, Butcher, Miner, and Cook, with no one else possibly having been there. 

Detecto began her investigation by poking around and asking questions, her keen eyes observing every detail and her ears attuned to every nuance in the responses she received. Butcher, with dramatic flair, protested her innocence, claiming she was in the kitchen preparing a lavish meal for the guests during the time of the murder, making her unavailable to commit the crime. Despite her protests, Detecto noted Butcher's access to various kitchen utensils, including knives, though none could be definitively linked to the murder, and her admiration for Gardener's work in the gardens seemed genuine.

As Butcher chopped vegetables, Detecto observed her humming a tune that reminded her of her grandmother's kitchen, a detail that seemed to ground her alibi. Cook, in a sing-song manner, also protested his innocence, insisting he was in the kitchen preparing food when the murder occurred, though Detecto had learned he had been seen peeking out into the hall several times during the gathering. This behavior suggested Cook had access to the trophy, as it was displayed in the hall where he occasionally went to check on the guests.

Detecto's attention turned to Miner, who spoke of how Gardener belittled her contributions, leaving her feeling humiliated and angry. Through careful questioning, Detecto discerned that Miner harbored a long-standing rivalry with Gardener over the hotel’s garden, a rivalry that had escalated into a personal vendetta. The murder weapon, a heavy brass trophy awarded to Gardener for her gardening excellence, had been seized by Miner in a moment of rage, and Detecto noted the trophy's weight and sharp edges made it a lethal choice in the heat of the moment.

Detecto pieced together that Gardener was vulnerable to attack during a quiet moment in the hall, shortly after a gathering of guests had dispersed, providing Miner the perfect opportunity to confront Gardener without the risk of being interrupted. Miner mentioned the auditorium had a peculiar smell of popcorn from a nearby event earlier in the day, a detail that seemed innocuous but added to the timeline of events. Nurse, with a sarcastic tone, protested his innocence, explaining he was in the auditorium engaged in a conversation with another guest, making him unaware of the events in the hall.

Detecto noted Nurse's access to a blowgun, part of a medical demonstration kit he had brought to the hotel, though he insisted it was merely a tool for his demonstration, not a weapon of murder. Nurse had a favorite pen shaped like a syringe, which Detecto found quirky but irrelevant to the murder. Miner, in a cheerful yet defensive manner, protested her innocence, claiming she picked up the trophy but lost her grip for a moment, a statement that Detecto found suspicious given the circumstances.

Cook's fingerprints were notably absent from the murder weapon, the trophy, as he had not touched it during the evening, a fact that Detecto confirmed through careful examination. After the commotion, Cook recalled how he had once spilled a pot of soup on his shoes, a detail that had become a running joke among the guests, further solidifying his alibi. Miner, in a moment of vulnerability, mentioned a particularly vibrant painting on the wall that depicted a serene landscape, which always made her feel calm, a detail that seemed to contrast with her earlier agitation.

Nurse, with a hint of suspicion, wondered aloud if Miner might have been involved, though he maintained his own innocence. As Detecto pieced together the evidence, she knew it must be one of these suspects, and she was confident she knew just who it was.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Gardener?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Butcher
- B: Nurse
- C: Cook
- D: Miner

## Correct Answer

The killer is Miner

## Reasoning

- [BEFORE_CRIME]	I had no motive to harm Gardener; in fact, I admired her work in the gardens. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Butcher)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	Cook's fingerprints were not found on the murder weapon, the trophy, as he had not touched it during the evening. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Cook)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	My blowgun was merely a tool for my demonstration, not a weapon of murder. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Nurse)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Miner wanted Gardener dead due to a long-standing rivalry over the hotel’s garden. Gardener had been dismissive of Miner’s efforts to beautify the grounds with her mining-themed sculptures, leading to a heated argument that escalated into a personal vendetta. Miner felt that Gardener's condescending attitude undermined her work and sought revenge for the humiliation she had endured. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Miner)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder weapon was a trophy, a heavy brass piece awarded to Gardener for her gardening excellence. In a moment of rage, Miner seized the trophy from a nearby display and struck Gardener with it, aiming for a fatal blow. The trophy's weight and sharp edges made it a lethal choice in the heat of the moment. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Miner)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Gardener was vulnerable to attack during a quiet moment in the hall, shortly after a gathering of guests had dispersed. The hall was dimly lit, and Gardener was alone, arranging flowers for the next event. This solitude provided Miner the perfect opportunity to confront Gardener without the risk of being interrupted. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Miner)

### Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder weapon was a trophy, a heavy brass piece awarded to Gardener for her gardening excellence. In a moment of rage, Miner seized the trophy from a nearby display and struck Gardener with it, aiming for a fatal blow. The trophy's weight and sharp edges made it a lethal choice in the heat of the moment.
Motive: Miner wanted Gardener dead due to a long-standing rivalry over the hotel’s garden. Gardener had been dismissive of Miner’s efforts to beautify the grounds with her mining-themed sculptures, leading to a heated argument that escalated into a personal vendetta. Miner felt that Gardener's condescending attitude undermined her work and sought revenge for the humiliation she had endured.
Opportunity: Gardener was vulnerable to attack during a quiet moment in the hall, shortly after a gathering of guests had dispersed. The hall was dimly lit, and Gardener was alone, arranging flowers for the next event. This solitude provided Miner the perfect opportunity to confront Gardener without the risk of being interrupted.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Miner and Gardener had been at the hotel’s auditorium for a gathering of guests, where tensions had flared during a discussion about the garden's upkeep. Gardener had belittled Miner’s contributions, which left Miner feeling humiliated and angry. After the event, Gardener retreated to the hall to arrange flowers, while Miner lingered behind, stewing in her resentment and plotting her next move.

The murder occurred in the hall, where Gardener was focused on her task, unaware of the brewing storm behind her. As Gardener adjusted the flowers, Miner approached quietly, her heart racing with a mix of anger and determination. In a sudden burst of emotion, she grabbed the trophy from a nearby display and swung it at Gardener, striking her with a force that knocked her to the ground, lifeless.

Afterward, Miner quickly composed herself, placing the trophy back on the display as if nothing had happened. She stepped back into the shadows of the hall, feigning surprise when other guests began to re-enter. Miner maintained her cheerful demeanor, blending in with the crowd, all the while concealing the dark secret of her actions.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the auditorium with everyone else, enjoying the gathering and the lively discussions. Gardener and I had a bit of a disagreement, but it was nothing unusual. I thought we had settled it, and I was just going to go back to my cheerful self. After the event, I decided to take a stroll through the hall to admire the flowers Gardener had arranged. They were quite lovely, you know. I was just admiring them when I noticed the trophy on display. It was a beautiful piece, and I thought it would be nice to take a closer look.

When I approached Gardener, she was so focused on her flowers that she didn’t even notice me at first. I was just standing there, admiring her work, when I suddenly felt a wave of frustration wash over me. It was as if all the times she had belittled my efforts came rushing back. I didn’t mean to do anything rash; I just wanted to express my feelings. I picked up the trophy, but it was heavy, and I lost my grip for a moment. It was an accident, really. I never intended to hurt her.

After the incident, I panicked for a moment, but I quickly regained my composure. I placed the trophy back where it belonged, and when the others started coming back into the hall, I made sure to act surprised. I couldn’t believe Gardener had collapsed! I rushed to her side, just like everyone else, and tried to help. I assure you, I had nothing to do with her death. It was just a terrible accident, and I was as shocked as anyone else.

### Parsed Story for Butcher

Means: Butcher has access to various kitchen utensils, including knives, but none that could be definitively linked to the murder.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Butcher was in the kitchen preparing a lavish meal for the guests during the time of the murder, making her unavailable to commit the crime.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Butcher was bustling about the kitchen of the Majestic Hotel, preparing an extravagant feast for the evening’s gathering. She was in high spirits, excited to showcase her culinary skills to the guests. As she chopped vegetables and seasoned meats, she occasionally peeked out of the kitchen door, catching snippets of the gathering in the auditorium. She noticed the tension between Gardener and Miner but dismissed it as typical guest squabbling, focusing instead on her culinary creations.

When the murder occurred, Butcher was still in the kitchen, fully engrossed in her work. The sounds of laughter and chatter from the auditorium faded as she concentrated on perfecting her dishes. She was unaware of the events unfolding in the hall, as the kitchen was a world of its own, filled with the sizzling of pans and the aroma of spices. The kitchen staff were busy, and Butcher felt a sense of camaraderie with them, oblivious to the dark turn of events just outside the kitchen door.

After the murder, Butcher was one of the first to hear the commotion as guests rushed back into the hall. She quickly wiped her hands on her apron and stepped out to see what had happened, her heart racing with concern. Upon discovering Gardener’s lifeless body, she gasped dramatically, her mind racing with thoughts of how the evening had taken such a tragic turn. Butcher immediately began to assist in the chaos, offering her help to the other guests, all the while trying to maintain her composure despite the shock of the situation.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was in the kitchen preparing a grand meal for the guests when the murder took place. I had no idea that anything was amiss until I heard the commotion from the hall. I was completely focused on my cooking, and the kitchen was bustling with activity, so I couldn’t have possibly committed the crime. I even had several kitchen staff members who can vouch for my whereabouts during that time.

I also mentioned that I had noticed the tension between Gardener and Miner earlier in the evening, but I thought it was just typical bickering among guests. I had no motive to harm Gardener; in fact, I admired her work in the gardens and often sought her advice on how to beautify the hotel grounds. The idea of wanting her dead is absurd, and I would never resort to violence, especially not in a place where I take such pride in my cooking.

Lastly, I pointed out that while I do have a collection of kitchen knives, none of them could be linked to the murder weapon. I even have a rare antique butcher knife that I keep hidden away, fearing it might lead to misunderstandings about my character. I’m an eccentric chef, not a murderer, and I implored the detective to consider the other guests who had more reason to harbor ill will toward Gardener.


### Parsed Story for Cook

Means: Cook had access to the trophy, as it was displayed in the hall where he occasionally went to check on the guests.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Cook was in the kitchen preparing food when the murder occurred, but he had been seen peeking out into the hall several times during the gathering.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Cook was bustling about the kitchen, preparing a lavish meal for the evening's gathering. He was in high spirits, humming a cheerful tune as he chopped vegetables and stirred sauces, occasionally glancing toward the auditorium to catch snippets of the ongoing discussions. He noticed the tension between Gardener and Miner but dismissed it as typical guest squabbling, focusing instead on impressing Butcher with his culinary skills.

When the murder occurred, Cook was still in the kitchen, fully engrossed in his work. He had just finished plating a particularly elaborate dish when he heard a sudden commotion from the hall. Curious, he stepped to the kitchen door and peeked out, catching a glimpse of Gardener arranging flowers. He felt a pang of guilt for not being more attentive to the gathering, but he quickly returned to his tasks, believing the noise was just part of the evening's festivities.

After the murder, Cook was one of the first to rush out of the kitchen upon hearing the gasps and shouts from the guests. He wiped his hands on his apron and hurried into the hall, where he was met with the shocking sight of Gardener’s lifeless body. Cook's heart raced as he tried to process the chaos around him. He immediately began assisting the guests, offering to help with anything they needed, all the while trying to maintain his composure despite the horror of the situation.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was busy in the kitchen preparing the evening meal when the murder took place. I was completely focused on my work, trying to impress Butcher with my culinary creations. I did notice some tension between Gardener and Miner, but I thought it was just typical guest squabbling and didn’t think much of it. I was in the kitchen the entire time, and I didn’t even know anything had happened until I heard the commotion from the hall.

When I heard the noise, I peeked out of the kitchen to see what was going on. I saw Gardener in the hall, but I didn’t see Miner at that moment. I quickly returned to my cooking, thinking it was just a minor disagreement among the guests. I was so focused on my dishes that I didn’t realize the severity of the situation until I stepped out into the hall and saw Gardener’s body. It was shocking, and I felt a wave of panic wash over me as I tried to help the other guests.

I want to emphasize that I had no motive to harm Gardener. I was simply trying to prepare a wonderful meal for everyone. I have always admired Gardener’s work, and I would never want to hurt her. I think you should look into Miner more closely; she seemed quite upset during the gathering, and I wouldn’t be surprised if she had something to do with it.


### Parsed Story for Nurse

Means: Nurse had access to a blowgun, which was part of a medical demonstration kit they had brought to the hotel.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Nurse was in the auditorium during the murder, engaged in a conversation with another guest, making them unaware of the events in the hall.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Nurse was in the auditorium, preparing for a medical demonstration that was scheduled to take place after the gathering. They were setting up their materials, including a blowgun, which they intended to use to illustrate a point about respiratory health. While arranging their items, Nurse overheard snippets of the heated discussion between Gardener and Miner, but they were too focused on their own presentation to pay much attention to the unfolding drama.

When the murder occurred, Nurse was still in the auditorium, engaged in a lively discussion with a guest about the merits of various medical practices. They were animatedly gesturing with their hands, completely oblivious to the chaos that erupted in the hall just a few feet away. The sounds of the commotion filtered into the auditorium, but Nurse assumed it was merely part of the evening's festivities and continued their conversation, unaware of the tragedy that had just unfolded.

After the murder, Nurse was one of the first to notice the sudden shift in atmosphere as guests rushed back into the auditorium, their faces pale and shocked. Curious, Nurse stepped out to investigate, only to be met with the horrifying sight of Gardener’s lifeless body. They quickly moved to assist, offering their medical expertise to help calm the panicked guests, all the while feeling a mix of disbelief and concern for the chaos that had erupted around them.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was busy preparing for a medical demonstration in the auditorium before the murder occurred. I had brought a blowgun as part of my materials, intending to use it to illustrate a point about respiratory health. I was engaged in a conversation with another guest when I heard the commotion from the hall, but I thought it was just part of the evening's festivities and didn’t think much of it at the time.

When I stepped out to see what was happening, I was shocked to find Gardener’s body on the floor. I rushed to assist the guests, trying to help calm the situation. I had no idea that anything so terrible had happened while I was in the auditorium. I would never harm anyone, especially not Gardener, despite her condescending attitude towards the staff. 

I couldn’t help but notice that Miner had been acting a bit too cheerful after the incident, which struck me as odd. It was almost as if she was trying to blend in too much, and I wondered if she might have been involved. But I assure you, I had no motive to harm Gardener, and my blowgun was merely a tool for my demonstration, not a weapon of murder.

### Full Prose Prompt

I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

# Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

This is a mystery story in the style of a golden age classic. The story features the following elements:

Victim: Gardener (a 59-year-old woman, pale and confident, who speaks in a formal manner)
Killer: Miner (a 33-year-old woman, redhead and cheerful, who speaks in a sing-song manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 29-year-old woman, lanky and grumpy, who speaks in a monotone manner)

Other Characters:
Butcher (a 38-year-old woman, fat and eccentric, who speaks in a dramatic manner), Cook (a 45-year-old man, blonde and outgoing, who speaks in a sing-song manner), Nurse (a 63-year-old man, redhead and grumpy, who speaks in a sarcastic manner)

It Takes Place In: Grand but remote hotel
The Crime Happened In: Hall
Other Locations in the Story: Auditorium, Garage

The Murder Weapon: Trophy
Other Suspicious Items: Blowgun

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Trophy in the Hall by Miner, killing Gardener. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In the grand, isolated Majestic Hotel, a cheerful miner stands accused of murdering a dignified gardener with a trophy in the hall. Detective Detecto must navigate a web of deceit and suspicion, as every eccentric guest holds their own secrets, and even the most innocuous items can become deadly.

Miner's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the auditorium with everyone else, enjoying the gathering and the lively discussions. Gardener and I had a bit of a disagreement, but it was nothing unusual. I thought we had settled it, and I was just going to go back to my cheerful self. After the event, I decided to take a stroll through the hall to admire the flowers Gardener had arranged. They were quite lovely, you know. I was just admiring them when I noticed the trophy on display. It was a beautiful piece, and I thought it would be nice to take a closer look.

When I approached Gardener, she was so focused on her flowers that she didn’t even notice me at first. I was just standing there, admiring her work, when I suddenly felt a wave of frustration wash over me. It was as if all the times she had belittled my efforts came rushing back. I didn’t mean to do anything rash; I just wanted to express my feelings. I picked up the trophy, but it was heavy, and I lost my grip for a moment. It was an accident, really. I never intended to hurt her.

After the incident, I panicked for a moment, but I quickly regained my composure. I placed the trophy back where it belonged, and when the others started coming back into the hall, I made sure to act surprised. I couldn’t believe Gardener had collapsed! I rushed to her side, just like everyone else, and tried to help. I assure you, I had nothing to do with her death. It was just a terrible accident, and I was as shocked as anyone else.

Butcher's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was in the kitchen preparing a grand meal for the guests when the murder took place. I had no idea that anything was amiss until I heard the commotion from the hall. I was completely focused on my cooking, and the kitchen was bustling with activity, so I couldn’t have possibly committed the crime. I even had several kitchen staff members who can vouch for my whereabouts during that time.

I also mentioned that I had noticed the tension between Gardener and Miner earlier in the evening, but I thought it was just typical bickering among guests. I had no motive to harm Gardener; in fact, I admired her work in the gardens and often sought her advice on how to beautify the hotel grounds. The idea of wanting her dead is absurd, and I would never resort to violence, especially not in a place where I take such pride in my cooking.

Lastly, I pointed out that while I do have a collection of kitchen knives, none of them could be linked to the murder weapon. I even have a rare antique butcher knife that I keep hidden away, fearing it might lead to misunderstandings about my character. I’m an eccentric chef, not a murderer, and I implored the detective to consider the other guests who had more reason to harbor ill will toward Gardener.


Cook's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was busy in the kitchen preparing the evening meal when the murder took place. I was completely focused on my work, trying to impress Butcher with my culinary creations. I did notice some tension between Gardener and Miner, but I thought it was just typical guest squabbling and didn’t think much of it. I was in the kitchen the entire time, and I didn’t even know anything had happened until I heard the commotion from the hall.

When I heard the noise, I peeked out of the kitchen to see what was going on. I saw Gardener in the hall, but I didn’t see Miner at that moment. I quickly returned to my cooking, thinking it was just a minor disagreement among the guests. I was so focused on my dishes that I didn’t realize the severity of the situation until I stepped out into the hall and saw Gardener’s body. It was shocking, and I felt a wave of panic wash over me as I tried to help the other guests.

I want to emphasize that I had no motive to harm Gardener. I was simply trying to prepare a wonderful meal for everyone. I have always admired Gardener’s work, and I would never want to hurt her. I think you should look into Miner more closely; she seemed quite upset during the gathering, and I wouldn’t be surprised if she had something to do with it.


Nurse's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was busy preparing for a medical demonstration in the auditorium before the murder occurred. I had brought a blowgun as part of my materials, intending to use it to illustrate a point about respiratory health. I was engaged in a conversation with another guest when I heard the commotion from the hall, but I thought it was just part of the evening's festivities and didn’t think much of it at the time.

When I stepped out to see what was happening, I was shocked to find Gardener’s body on the floor. I rushed to assist the guests, trying to help calm the situation. I had no idea that anything so terrible had happened while I was in the auditorium. I would never harm anyone, especially not Gardener, despite her condescending attitude towards the staff. 

I couldn’t help but notice that Miner had been acting a bit too cheerful after the incident, which struck me as odd. It was almost as if she was trying to blend in too much, and I wondered if she might have been involved. But I assure you, I had no motive to harm Gardener, and my blowgun was merely a tool for my demonstration, not a weapon of murder.

# Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point.

### Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the grand yet remote Majestic Hotel, her lanky frame casting a shadow over the scene of the crime where the dignified Gardener lay dead on the floor of the hall, clearly murdered with a trophy, its sharp edges stained with blood. As she surveyed the room, her monotone voice cut through the tension, noting that only four people were present: Nurse, Butcher, Miner, and Cook, with no one else possibly having been there. 

Detecto began her investigation by poking around and asking questions, her keen eyes observing every detail and her ears attuned to every nuance in the responses she received. Butcher, with dramatic flair, protested her innocence, claiming she was in the kitchen preparing a lavish meal for the guests during the time of the murder, making her unavailable to commit the crime. Despite her protests, Detecto noted Butcher's access to various kitchen utensils, including knives, though none could be definitively linked to the murder, and her admiration for Gardener's work in the gardens seemed genuine.

As Butcher chopped vegetables, Detecto observed her humming a tune that reminded her of her grandmother's kitchen, a detail that seemed to ground her alibi. Cook, in a sing-song manner, also protested his innocence, insisting he was in the kitchen preparing food when the murder occurred, though Detecto had learned he had been seen peeking out into the hall several times during the gathering. This behavior suggested Cook had access to the trophy, as it was displayed in the hall where he occasionally went to check on the guests.

Detecto's attention turned to Miner, who spoke of how Gardener belittled her contributions, leaving her feeling humiliated and angry. Through careful questioning, Detecto discerned that Miner harbored a long-standing rivalry with Gardener over the hotel’s garden, a rivalry that had escalated into a personal vendetta. The murder weapon, a heavy brass trophy awarded to Gardener for her gardening excellence, had been seized by Miner in a moment of rage, and Detecto noted the trophy's weight and sharp edges made it a lethal choice in the heat of the moment.

Detecto pieced together that Gardener was vulnerable to attack during a quiet moment in the hall, shortly after a gathering of guests had dispersed, providing Miner the perfect opportunity to confront Gardener without the risk of being interrupted. Miner mentioned the auditorium had a peculiar smell of popcorn from a nearby event earlier in the day, a detail that seemed innocuous but added to the timeline of events. Nurse, with a sarcastic tone, protested his innocence, explaining he was in the auditorium engaged in a conversation with another guest, making him unaware of the events in the hall.

Detecto noted Nurse's access to a blowgun, part of a medical demonstration kit he had brought to the hotel, though he insisted it was merely a tool for his demonstration, not a weapon of murder. Nurse had a favorite pen shaped like a syringe, which Detecto found quirky but irrelevant to the murder. Miner, in a cheerful yet defensive manner, protested her innocence, claiming she picked up the trophy but lost her grip for a moment, a statement that Detecto found suspicious given the circumstances.

Cook's fingerprints were notably absent from the murder weapon, the trophy, as he had not touched it during the evening, a fact that Detecto confirmed through careful examination. After the commotion, Cook recalled how he had once spilled a pot of soup on his shoes, a detail that had become a running joke among the guests, further solidifying his alibi. Miner, in a moment of vulnerability, mentioned a particularly vibrant painting on the wall that depicted a serene landscape, which always made her feel calm, a detail that seemed to contrast with her earlier agitation.

Nurse, with a hint of suspicion, wondered aloud if Miner might have been involved, though he maintained his own innocence. As Detecto pieced together the evidence, she knew it must be one of these suspects, and she was confident she knew just who it was.
