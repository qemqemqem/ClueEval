# Club of Shadows

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the exclusive members-only club, his freckled face a mask of concentration as he surveyed the scene of the crime. The victim, the club's chauffeur, lay lifeless on the office floor, a hammer resting ominously nearby, its handle stained with blood. 

Detecto noted the presence of four individuals: the Lawyer, the Artist, the Butler, and the Nanny, each a potential suspect in this grim tableau. "No one else could have been here," he mused aloud, his voice carrying a verbose authority that demanded attention.

He began his investigation by speaking with the Artist, who claimed, "I was in the art studio, completely absorbed in my sculpture when the murder occurred." Detecto's eyes lingered on the hammer, recalling the Artist's access to such tools for his work, a detail the Artist had not volunteered.

Turning to the Butler, Detecto inquired about her whereabouts during the murder. "I was in the bathroom," she replied, her gravelly voice tinged with defensiveness, aware that her absence might appear suspicious.

The Lawyer, maintaining an air of nonchalance, protested her innocence, "I assure you, Detective, I had no reason to harm the Chauffeur." Yet, Detecto's keen mind pieced together the motive: the Chauffeur had uncovered sensitive information about the Lawyer's dealings, a threat to her career she could not afford.

Detecto's attention shifted to the Nanny, who remarked, "I noticed the tension between Chauffeur and Lawyer earlier." The Nanny's terse manner belied the unease Detecto sensed, as he deduced the Nanny's absence at a church service during the murder.

The Artist, eager to clear his name, insisted, "Other club members saw me in the studio; I wasn't near the office." Detecto noted the Artist's proximity to the murder weapon, a fact that could not be ignored.

The Lawyer, in an attempt to divert attention, commented on the club's peculiarities, "The painting of a cat with a monocle always makes me chuckle," she said, her laughter hollow in the somber setting.

Detecto listened as the Butler recounted her return from the bathroom, "I was shocked to find everyone gathered, whispering about Chauffeur's death." Her story seemed plausible, yet Detecto remained vigilant for inconsistencies.

The Nanny, his anxiety palpable, chose to remain silent about the earlier argument between Chauffeur and Lawyer, a decision that piqued Detecto's curiosity. "I felt a wave of anxiety," the Nanny admitted, aware that his absence might cast suspicion upon him.

As Detecto pieced together the evening's events, he observed the Artist's protestations of innocence, "I was in the studio, lost in my work." Yet, the hammer's presence loomed large in Detecto's mind, a silent witness to the crime.

The Lawyer, attempting to establish an alibi, mentioned, "At ten o'clock, I found Chauffeur engrossed in his work in the office." Detecto noted the timing, aligning it with the moment of the murder.

The Butler, eager to assert her innocence, described a scene of levity, "I saw a member trying to balance coasters on their head as a joke." Her attempt at humor did little to dispel the gravity of the situation.

Detecto, his mind a whirlwind of deductions, knew that the truth lay hidden among these tangled stories. "It must be one of these suspects," he thought, his freckled brow furrowed in contemplation, "and I know just who it is."

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Chauffeur?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Artist
- B: Butler
- C: Nanny
- D: Lawyer

## Correct Answer

The killer is Lawyer

## Reasoning

- [AFTER_CRIME]	When I returned from the bathroom, I was shocked to find everyone gathered, whispering about Chauffeur's death. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Butler)
- [DURING_CRIME]	The murder took place in the office while Nanny was away at the church. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Nanny)
- [DURING_CRIME]	Other club members who were in the lounge area can confirm that Artist was not present during the murder, as they saw him working in the studio. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Artist)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Lawyer wanted Chauffeur dead because he had discovered sensitive information about her dealings with a client that could jeopardize her career and reputation. The Chauffeur had been overheard discussing this information with others, and Lawyer feared that if it became public, it would ruin her standing in the exclusive club and the legal community. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Lawyer)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a hammer, which was a tool commonly found in the office for various maintenance tasks. It was an item that could easily be overlooked as a potential weapon. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Lawyer)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Chauffeur was vulnerable to attack when he was alone in the office, reviewing documents late at night. The club was quiet at that hour, and the lack of witnesses provided the perfect chance for Lawyer to confront him without interruption. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Lawyer)
