# Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a length of rope, which Actor had brought with him for a theatrical prop. The rope was initially intended for a scene in a play, but it became the instrument of the crime.
Motive: Actor wanted Lawyer dead because he felt overshadowed by Lawyer's success and influence in the legal world. Actor believed that Lawyer had sabotaged his career by spreading rumors that tarnished his reputation, leading to a series of failed auditions and diminishing roles. This resentment festered over time, culminating in a desire for revenge.
Opportunity: Lawyer was vulnerable to attack when he was alone in the bathroom, a secluded area where he felt safe and secure. The timing coincided with a break in the evening's activities, allowing Actor to approach without raising suspicion.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Actor and Lawyer had been attending a gathering at the exclusive boarding school, mingling with other guests. Tensions had been simmering between them throughout the evening, with Actor feeling increasingly agitated by Lawyer's self-assured demeanor and the way he commanded attention. After a particularly heated exchange in the ballroom, Actor excused himself, claiming he needed a moment to gather his thoughts. He made his way to the bathroom, where he planned to confront Lawyer.

In the bathroom, Lawyer was alone, oblivious to the brewing storm outside. Actor entered quietly, the rope coiled in his hand, and confronted Lawyer about the rumors that had ruined his career. The confrontation escalated quickly, with Actor's clumsiness turning into a frenzied attack. He wrapped the rope around Lawyer's neck, using his lanky frame to leverage the pressure. Lawyer struggled, but the surprise and the confined space worked against him, and he succumbed to the attack.

Afterward, Actor panicked. He quickly removed the rope and hid it in a nearby stall, ensuring it wouldn’t be found immediately. He composed himself, splashed water on his face, and exited the bathroom, trying to appear nonchalant. He rejoined the party, feigning ignorance about the commotion that would soon follow, all while his heart raced with the weight of his actions.


Story to Detective: 


I assure you, I had no part in this dreadful affair. I was merely minding my own business, trying to enjoy the evening, when I felt the need to step away for a moment. You see, I had been feeling rather overwhelmed by the atmosphere, and I thought a brief respite in the bathroom would do me good. I had no intention of causing any trouble, especially not with Lawyer. He was always so pompous, strutting around like he owned the place. I simply wanted to clear my head, nothing more.

When I entered the bathroom, I found Lawyer there, and I must admit, I was taken aback by his presence. We exchanged a few words, but it was all rather benign, if you ask me. I had the rope with me, yes, but it was just a prop for my upcoming performance. I had no plans to use it for anything sinister. I was merely showing it to Lawyer, trying to lighten the mood, you know? But then, things took a turn. He became agitated, and I felt cornered. I assure you, I would never resort to violence. It was all a misunderstanding, a tragic accident.

Afterward, I left the bathroom, feeling quite shaken. I joined the others, trying to act as if nothing had happened. I thought perhaps I could shake off the unease that had settled in my stomach. I didn’t hear any commotion until much later, and by then, I was already lost in my thoughts, pondering the evening’s events. I had no idea what had transpired until the news broke. It’s all so terribly unfortunate, but I assure you, I am innocent of any wrongdoing.

# Parsed Story for Chauffeur

Means: Chauffeur had access to the bathroom where the murder occurred, but he did not possess the rope or any weapon.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Chauffeur was busy driving guests to and from the boarding school, making him unavailable during the time of the murder.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Chauffeur was occupied with his duties, shuttling guests to and from the exclusive boarding school. He had been working tirelessly throughout the evening, ensuring that everyone arrived safely and on time. His formal demeanor and pale complexion made him appear somewhat out of place among the more flamboyant guests, but he focused on his job, trying to ignore the rising tensions he sensed among the attendees.

When the murder occurred, Chauffeur was outside, waiting for a group of guests to return from the ballroom. He was parked near the entrance, keeping an eye on the door while listening to the muffled sounds of laughter and conversation coming from within. He had no idea that a confrontation was brewing in the bathroom just a few feet away. His attention was diverted when a couple of guests approached him, asking for a ride to a nearby hotel, which further delayed his return to the main gathering.

After the murder was discovered, Chauffeur rushed back inside, alarmed by the commotion. He joined the crowd gathering around the bathroom, feigning concern while trying to piece together what had happened. His grumpy demeanor made him seem aloof, but he was genuinely shocked and confused by the unfolding events. He remained close to the scene, hoping to gather information while also trying to avoid drawing attention to himself, fearing that his financial troubles might surface in the chaos.


Story to Detective: 


I was merely fulfilling my duties as the chauffeur for the evening, ensuring that all guests arrived safely at the boarding school. My responsibilities kept me occupied, and I was outside waiting for a group of guests to return from the ballroom when the unfortunate incident occurred. I had no knowledge of any confrontation happening in the bathroom, as my focus was entirely on my job. I was not in the vicinity of the murder, and I certainly had no reason to harm the lawyer.

Upon hearing the commotion, I hurried back inside to see what had transpired. I was genuinely alarmed and concerned, as I had no idea that something so dreadful had taken place. I joined the crowd near the bathroom, trying to gather information about the situation. My formal manner may have come off as suspicious, but I assure you, my only intention was to understand what had happened and to assist in any way I could.

I must emphasize that I had no motive to harm the lawyer. My financial troubles are my own, and I would never resort to violence. I believe that the actor, with his clumsy demeanor and history of agitation towards the lawyer, should be scrutinized more closely. It is he who had the opportunity and the motive, while I was simply doing my job.


# Parsed Story for Sailor

Means: None
Motive: None
Opportunity: Sailor was in the ballroom when the murder occurred, mingling with other guests and dancing, making it impossible for her to have attacked Lawyer.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Sailor was enjoying the gathering in the ballroom, chatting animatedly with other guests and sharing stories about her time at sea. Her enthusiastic nature made her a lively presence, and she was often the center of attention, regaling everyone with tales of her adventures. She had a few drinks and was in high spirits, completely unaware of the tension brewing between Actor and Lawyer.

When the murder occurred, Sailor was still in the ballroom, dancing with a group of guests. The music was loud, and the atmosphere was festive, which meant she didn’t hear the commotion happening just a few feet away in the bathroom. She was caught up in the excitement, laughing and enjoying herself, oblivious to the fact that a confrontation was escalating nearby.

After the murder was discovered, Sailor was one of the first to rush toward the bathroom, drawn by the sudden change in atmosphere. She was shocked to see the crowd gathering and the panic unfolding. In her clumsy enthusiasm, she accidentally bumped into several people, making her seem even more flustered. Sailor tried to help, offering her assistance to those around her, but her eagerness only added to the suspicion surrounding her actions.


Story to Detective: 


I was having a wonderful time at the party, you see! I was in the ballroom, surrounded by laughter and music, sharing my sea stories with anyone who would listen. I was dancing and enjoying the company of the guests, completely caught up in the moment. I didn’t even notice the tension between Actor and Lawyer; I was too busy having fun and being my cheerful self. 

When I heard the commotion, I thought it was just part of the festivities. I rushed over to see what was happening, and I was horrified to find everyone gathered around the bathroom. I stumbled into a few people in my excitement, trying to get a glimpse of what was going on. I assure you, I had no idea that anything serious was happening until I saw the panic on everyone’s faces. 

I understand why I might seem suspicious, but I promise you, I had no motive to harm Lawyer. We had a brief history, yes, but it was years ago, and I had moved on. I was just a clumsy old sailor caught up in the joy of the evening, and I would never wish harm on anyone, especially not someone I once cared about. You should really look into Actor; he seemed quite agitated earlier, and I noticed him lurking around the bathroom before everything happened.


# Parsed Story for Artist

Means: Artist had access to various art supplies, including a paintbrush that could be misconstrued as a weapon.
Motive: None.
Opportunity: Artist was in the ballroom, mingling with guests, when the murder occurred.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Artist was in the ballroom, surrounded by the lively atmosphere of the gathering. He was attempting to engage with other guests, showcasing his latest artwork and seeking validation for his talent. However, he felt increasingly anxious as he noticed Lawyer's presence, knowing that Lawyer had been critical of his work in the past. Artist's nervousness made him fidgety, and he often glanced toward the bathroom, sensing the tension building between Actor and Lawyer.

When the murder occurred, Artist was still in the ballroom, caught up in a conversation with a group of guests. The music was loud, and the laughter masked the sounds of the confrontation happening just a few feet away. Artist was animatedly discussing his latest painting, oblivious to the brewing storm in the bathroom. His focus on the conversation and the festive atmosphere kept him from noticing the shift in energy that would soon lead to chaos.

After the murder was discovered, Artist's demeanor changed dramatically. He felt a wave of panic wash over him as he rushed toward the bathroom, drawn by the commotion. In his haste, he stumbled and knocked over a decorative vase, which only added to the chaos. Once inside, he was horrified to see the crowd gathering around the scene. Artist's nervousness made him appear even more suspicious as he tried to help, but his clumsiness only fueled the suspicion surrounding him.


Story to Detective: 


I assure you, I had no part in this dreadful incident. I was in the ballroom, surrounded by guests, discussing my latest painting. I was so engrossed in the conversation that I didn’t even notice the tension building between Actor and Lawyer. My focus was entirely on my art and the validation I sought from my peers. I was not in the bathroom, nor did I have any motive to harm Lawyer. My only concern was my career, which has been suffering due to his harsh critiques.

When the commotion erupted, I was startled and rushed toward the bathroom, hoping to understand what had happened. In my haste, I accidentally knocked over a vase, which I fear only added to the suspicion surrounding me. I was simply trying to help, but my nervousness made me clumsy. I assure you, I had no intention of drawing attention to myself; I was merely caught up in the chaos of the moment.

If you must look for someone with a motive, I suggest you consider Actor. He had been agitated all evening, and I could sense the tension between them. I overheard snippets of their conversation, and it was clear that Actor felt wronged by Lawyer. I was merely an innocent bystander, trying to navigate my own struggles while the real drama unfolded around me.

# Full Prose Prompt

I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

## Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

This is a mystery story in the style of a golden age classic. The story features the following elements:

Victim: Lawyer (a 43-year-old man, thin and stoic, who speaks in a verbose manner)
Killer: Actor (a 56-year-old man, lanky and clumsy, who speaks in a drawling manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 44-year-old woman, average height and energetic, who speaks in a gravelly manner)

Other Characters:
Chauffeur (a 28-year-old man, pale and grumpy, who speaks in a formal manner), Sailor (a 59-year-old woman, redhead and clumsy, who speaks in a enthusiastic manner), Artist (a 54-year-old man, average height and nervous, who speaks in a dramatic manner)

It Takes Place In: Exclusive boarding school
The Crime Happened In: Bathroom
Other Locations in the Story: Ballroom, Studio

The Murder Weapon: Rope
Other Suspicious Items: Syringe

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Rope in the Bathroom by Actor, killing Lawyer. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In the hallowed halls of an exclusive boarding school, a verbose lawyer is found strangled in the bathroom. With a list of eccentric suspects and a rope as her only lead, Detective Detecto must untangle the truth from an actor's deadly performance.

Actor's Story to the Detective: 


I assure you, I had no part in this dreadful affair. I was merely minding my own business, trying to enjoy the evening, when I felt the need to step away for a moment. You see, I had been feeling rather overwhelmed by the atmosphere, and I thought a brief respite in the bathroom would do me good. I had no intention of causing any trouble, especially not with Lawyer. He was always so pompous, strutting around like he owned the place. I simply wanted to clear my head, nothing more.

When I entered the bathroom, I found Lawyer there, and I must admit, I was taken aback by his presence. We exchanged a few words, but it was all rather benign, if you ask me. I had the rope with me, yes, but it was just a prop for my upcoming performance. I had no plans to use it for anything sinister. I was merely showing it to Lawyer, trying to lighten the mood, you know? But then, things took a turn. He became agitated, and I felt cornered. I assure you, I would never resort to violence. It was all a misunderstanding, a tragic accident.

Afterward, I left the bathroom, feeling quite shaken. I joined the others, trying to act as if nothing had happened. I thought perhaps I could shake off the unease that had settled in my stomach. I didn’t hear any commotion until much later, and by then, I was already lost in my thoughts, pondering the evening’s events. I had no idea what had transpired until the news broke. It’s all so terribly unfortunate, but I assure you, I am innocent of any wrongdoing.

Chauffeur's Story to the Detective: 


I was merely fulfilling my duties as the chauffeur for the evening, ensuring that all guests arrived safely at the boarding school. My responsibilities kept me occupied, and I was outside waiting for a group of guests to return from the ballroom when the unfortunate incident occurred. I had no knowledge of any confrontation happening in the bathroom, as my focus was entirely on my job. I was not in the vicinity of the murder, and I certainly had no reason to harm the lawyer.

Upon hearing the commotion, I hurried back inside to see what had transpired. I was genuinely alarmed and concerned, as I had no idea that something so dreadful had taken place. I joined the crowd near the bathroom, trying to gather information about the situation. My formal manner may have come off as suspicious, but I assure you, my only intention was to understand what had happened and to assist in any way I could.

I must emphasize that I had no motive to harm the lawyer. My financial troubles are my own, and I would never resort to violence. I believe that the actor, with his clumsy demeanor and history of agitation towards the lawyer, should be scrutinized more closely. It is he who had the opportunity and the motive, while I was simply doing my job.


Sailor's Story to the Detective: 


I was having a wonderful time at the party, you see! I was in the ballroom, surrounded by laughter and music, sharing my sea stories with anyone who would listen. I was dancing and enjoying the company of the guests, completely caught up in the moment. I didn’t even notice the tension between Actor and Lawyer; I was too busy having fun and being my cheerful self. 

When I heard the commotion, I thought it was just part of the festivities. I rushed over to see what was happening, and I was horrified to find everyone gathered around the bathroom. I stumbled into a few people in my excitement, trying to get a glimpse of what was going on. I assure you, I had no idea that anything serious was happening until I saw the panic on everyone’s faces. 

I understand why I might seem suspicious, but I promise you, I had no motive to harm Lawyer. We had a brief history, yes, but it was years ago, and I had moved on. I was just a clumsy old sailor caught up in the joy of the evening, and I would never wish harm on anyone, especially not someone I once cared about. You should really look into Actor; he seemed quite agitated earlier, and I noticed him lurking around the bathroom before everything happened.


Artist's Story to the Detective: 


I assure you, I had no part in this dreadful incident. I was in the ballroom, surrounded by guests, discussing my latest painting. I was so engrossed in the conversation that I didn’t even notice the tension building between Actor and Lawyer. My focus was entirely on my art and the validation I sought from my peers. I was not in the bathroom, nor did I have any motive to harm Lawyer. My only concern was my career, which has been suffering due to his harsh critiques.

When the commotion erupted, I was startled and rushed toward the bathroom, hoping to understand what had happened. In my haste, I accidentally knocked over a vase, which I fear only added to the suspicion surrounding me. I was simply trying to help, but my nervousness made me clumsy. I assure you, I had no intention of drawing attention to myself; I was merely caught up in the chaos of the moment.

If you must look for someone with a motive, I suggest you consider Actor. He had been agitated all evening, and I could sense the tension between them. I overheard snippets of their conversation, and it was clear that Actor felt wronged by Lawyer. I was merely an innocent bystander, trying to navigate my own struggles while the real drama unfolded around me.

## Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.
You should use dialog to convey information engage the reader.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point, narrated by Detecto and using dialog where appropriate.

# Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the exclusive boarding school, her gravelly voice cutting through the tense atmosphere as she surveyed the scene of the crime. The bathroom was a grim tableau, with the lawyer's lifeless body sprawled on the floor, the rope still cruelly entwined around his neck. Only four people were present: the Artist, the Sailor, the Chauffeur, and the Actor, each with their own peculiarities and potential motives. 

Detecto began her investigation, her keen eyes and sharp mind piecing together the puzzle from the fragments of conversation and the subtle clues scattered about. The Actor, a lanky and clumsy man, protested his innocence, claiming, "I assure you, Detective, I had no part in this dreadful affair." Yet, Detecto noticed the Actor's hands trembled slightly when he spoke of the Lawyer's earlier jest about his dance moves, a seemingly innocuous comment that had everyone laughing.

The Artist, with his dramatic flair, insisted, "I was not in the bathroom, nor did I have any motive to harm Lawyer," but Detecto's attention was drawn to the paintbrush tucked into his pocket, a potential weapon in the wrong hands. Despite his protests, the Artist's habit of doodling on napkins during conversations seemed to amuse the guests, providing him with an alibi as he mingled in the ballroom when the murder occurred.

The Chauffeur, pale and grumpy, maintained, "I had no knowledge of any confrontation happening in the bathroom," yet Detecto couldn't ignore the fact that he had access to the area, though he lacked any weapon. His formal manner did little to mask his financial troubles, but his alibi was solid, as he was busy driving guests to and from the school during the time of the murder.

The Sailor, with her enthusiastic demeanor, declared, "I had no motive to harm Lawyer," her clumsy enthusiasm evident as she recounted bumping into several people in her excitement. Detecto noted her genuine surprise at the commotion, as she had been dancing and complimenting the ornate chandeliers in the ballroom when the crime took place.

As Detecto pieced together the evening's events, she observed the Actor rejoining the party, feigning ignorance about the commotion, while the Artist, in his haste, stumbled and knocked over a decorative vase, adding to the chaos. The Chauffeur hurried back inside upon hearing the commotion, while the Sailor's eagerness to help only added to the suspicion surrounding her actions.

Detecto's mind raced as she considered the evidence, each suspect's story weaving a complex tapestry of motives and opportunities. It must be one of these suspects, and Detecto knew just who it was.
