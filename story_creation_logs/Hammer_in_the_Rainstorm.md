# Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a hammer, which was readily available in the cottage where the Chauffeur was found. The hammer was typically used for maintenance work around the castle, making it an unassuming weapon.
Motive: Teacher wanted Chauffeur dead because he felt threatened by the young man's growing influence over the other staff and the potential for Chauffeur to expose Teacher's questionable methods of teaching and personal conduct. Teacher believed that eliminating Chauffeur would restore his authority and control over the castle's staff.
Opportunity: Chauffeur was vulnerable to attack when he was alone in the cottage, preparing for the evening's events. The storm outside created a loud backdrop, masking any sounds of struggle or distress, allowing Teacher to approach without being heard.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Teacher and Chauffeur were in the castle's main hall, discussing the evening's plans. Chauffeur, in his laid-back manner, was joking and singing, which annoyed Teacher. As the conversation progressed, Teacher felt increasingly agitated by Chauffeur's carefree attitude and the way he interacted with the other staff. After a brief exchange, Teacher excused himself, claiming he needed to gather some materials for the evening's activities.

Once alone, Teacher made his way to the cottage where Chauffeur was preparing. The rain poured heavily outside, creating a cacophony that drowned out any potential noises. Teacher entered the cottage quietly, finding Chauffeur distracted and unaware of his presence. In a sudden moment of rage and desperation, Teacher seized the hammer from a nearby toolbox and struck Chauffeur, ensuring that the act was swift and decisive.

After the murder, Teacher quickly cleaned the scene, placing the hammer back in its original position and arranging the cottage to look undisturbed. He then returned to the main hall, where he feigned ignorance about Chauffeur's whereabouts. As the storm raged on outside, Teacher maintained his calm demeanor, blending in with the other characters, all while the tension of his actions loomed just beneath the surface.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the main hall earlier, discussing plans for the evening with Chauffeur. He was being his usual self, joking around and singing, which I found rather irritating. I excused myself to gather some materials, but honestly, I needed a moment to clear my head. The rain was pouring outside, and I thought it would be a good time to check on the cottage, where Chauffeur was supposed to be preparing. I had no idea what he was up to in there, but I figured I could use the time to gather my thoughts.

When I arrived at the cottage, I found him completely engrossed in his work, singing away as if nothing else mattered. I felt a surge of frustration; he was so carefree, and it made me feel like I was losing control. I grabbed the hammer from the toolbox, thinking I might use it for some repairs later. But in that moment, I lost my temper. I didn't plan anything; it just happened. I struck him, and it was over before I realized what I had done. I panicked for a moment, but I quickly composed myself.

Afterward, I returned to the main hall, trying to act as if nothing had happened. I knew the storm would cover any noise, and I made sure to put everything back in its place. I didn't want anyone to suspect anything was wrong. I was just trying to keep things normal, you know? I had no idea where Chauffeur had gone; I assumed he was still busy in the cottage. I was just trying to maintain order in the chaos of the storm.

# Parsed Story for Farmer

Means: Farmer has access to a shovel from the garden shed, which could be misconstrued as a weapon.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Farmer was in the castle's kitchen preparing food for the evening when the murder occurred.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Farmer was busy in the castle's kitchen, preparing a lavish meal for the evening's guests. He was chopping vegetables and stirring pots, trying to keep his mind off his mounting debts. As he worked, he occasionally glanced out the window at the storm, feeling a sense of unease. He had heard the laughter and singing from the main hall, where Chauffeur was entertaining the guests, but he focused on his tasks, hoping to avoid any confrontation about his financial troubles.

When the murder took place, Farmer remained in the kitchen, unaware of the events unfolding in the cottage. The sound of the rain and thunder masked any noise that might have come from the cottage. He was preoccupied with his cooking, occasionally checking on the other staff members, who seemed equally busy. Farmer felt a twinge of guilt for not joining the festivities, but he was too anxious about his debts to enjoy himself.

After the murder, Farmer continued his work in the kitchen, but he became increasingly nervous as time passed and Chauffeur did not return. When the other staff members began to gather, Farmer's anxiety grew. He tried to act normal, but his fidgeting and darting glances made him appear suspicious. When Detective Detecto arrived, Farmer felt a wave of panic wash over him, fearing that his nervous demeanor would draw attention to him, despite his innocence.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the kitchen preparing dinner when the murder happened. I had my hands full with chopping and cooking, and I didn't hear anything unusual over the sound of the rain. I know it might seem odd that I was so focused on my work, but I had a lot on my mind. You see, I’ve been struggling with some financial issues, and I was trying to keep my head down and avoid any trouble. I didn’t want anyone to notice how anxious I was feeling.

I didn’t leave the kitchen until I was called by the others. I was worried about the meal and making sure everything was perfect for the guests. When I finally stepped out, I noticed that everyone was acting strangely, and I felt a knot in my stomach. I had no idea what had happened until I heard about Chauffeur. I couldn’t believe it. I had no reason to harm him; in fact, I thought he was a good lad, always cheerful and light-hearted.

I understand why I might look suspicious, but I assure you, I had no motive. I was just trying to keep my head down and focus on my work. If you want to know who might have had a reason to be upset with Chauffeur, I’d suggest looking at Teacher. He seemed agitated earlier in the evening, and I overheard some tense words exchanged between them. I just want to clear my name and get back to my work without this hanging over me.


# Parsed Story for Accountant

Means: Accountant had access to the hammer in the toolbox, but he did not use it.

Accountant kept glancing toward the door, hoping to avoid any questions about his financial troubles, and he engaged in small talk with the other staff members, trying to appear relaxed while masking his anxiety.

When the murder occurred, Accountant remained in the main hall, surrounded by guests who were oblivious to the tension brewing beneath the surface. He was engaged in a conversation with Cook about the evening's menu, and the sound of the rain and thunder made it difficult to hear anything happening outside. Accountant felt a sense of relief that he was not alone, but he couldn't shake the feeling of dread as he noticed the time passing without any sign of Chauffeur.

After the murder, Accountant continued to socialize, but his demeanor changed as he became increasingly aware of the absence of Chauffeur. When the other staff members began to gather, he felt a wave of panic wash over him, fearing that his nervousness would draw attention. Accountant tried to act normal, but his fidgeting and mumbling made him appear suspicious. When Detective Detecto arrived, Accountant felt trapped, knowing that his financial troubles could be misconstrued as a motive for murder.

I felt uneasy, but I tried to maintain my composure, knowing that I couldn’t let anyone see how anxious I was about my gambling debts. I kept glancing toward the door, hoping Chauffeur would come back soon, but I didn’t think much of it at the time.

When the murder happened, I was still in the main hall, surrounded by guests. The storm outside was loud, and I was focused on the conversation with Cook. I didn’t hear anything unusual, and I certainly didn’t see anything suspicious. I was too busy trying to keep my mind off my debts and blend in with the others. I thought it was a good opportunity to distract myself, but I had no idea that something terrible was happening just a short distance away.

After the murder, I noticed that Chauffeur was still missing, and I began to feel more anxious. I tried to act normal, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was very wrong. When the other staff members started to gather, I felt a knot in my stomach. I was worried that my nervousness would make me look guilty, especially with Detective Detecto arriving. I assure you, I had nothing to do with it. I was simply trying to avoid drawing attention to myself because of my debts, which I’ve kept hidden from everyone.

Despite the laughter and singing coming from the main hall, Cook remained dedicated to their work, hoping that a successful dinner would help ease their worries.

When the murder took place, Cook was still in the kitchen, completely unaware of the events unfolding in the cottage. The sound of the rain and thunder drowned out any potential noises from the cottage, and Cook was too preoccupied with their cooking to notice anything amiss. They were busy plating the first course when they heard the distant sound of thunder, which only added to their anxiety about the evening's success.

After the murder, Cook continued to work in the kitchen, but their nerves began to fray as time passed without any sign of Chauffeur. When the other staff members started to gather, Cook felt a wave of panic wash over them, fearing that their anxious demeanor would draw attention.

I know I must have looked suspicious, but I swear I had nothing to do with it. I was just trying to do my job.

# Full Prose Prompt

I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

## Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

This is a mystery story in the style of a golden age classic. The story features the following elements:

Victim: Chauffeur (a 23-year-old man, grey-haired and laid-back, who speaks in a sing-song manner)
Killer: Teacher (a 52-year-old man, tanned and laid-back, who speaks in a terse manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 33-year-old man, pale and confident, who speaks in a blunt manner)

Other Characters:
Farmer (a 54-year-old man, fat and nervous, who speaks in a articulate manner), Accountant (a 50-year-old man, redhead and confident, who speaks in a mumbling manner), Cook (a 44-year-old man, tall and nervous, who speaks in a monotone manner)

It Takes Place In: Gothic castle on a cliff in a rainstorm
The Crime Happened In: Cottage
Other Locations in the Story: Closet, Theater

The Murder Weapon: Hammer
Other Suspicious Items: Bow And Arrow

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Hammer in the Cottage by Teacher, killing Chauffeur. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In the eerie setting of a Gothic castle during a relentless rainstorm, the young chauffeur is found brutally murdered with a hammer in a quiet cottage. Detective Detecto, a blunt and confident investigator, must navigate through a web of deception involving a bow and arrow, a closet theater, and a cast of suspicious characters, only to discover the killer is closer than he thinks.

Teacher's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the main hall earlier, discussing plans for the evening with Chauffeur. He was being his usual self, joking around and singing, which I found rather irritating. I excused myself to gather some materials, but honestly, I needed a moment to clear my head. The rain was pouring outside, and I thought it would be a good time to check on the cottage, where Chauffeur was supposed to be preparing. I had no idea what he was up to in there, but I figured I could use the time to gather my thoughts.

When I arrived at the cottage, I found him completely engrossed in his work, singing away as if nothing else mattered. I felt a surge of frustration; he was so carefree, and it made me feel like I was losing control. I grabbed the hammer from the toolbox, thinking I might use it for some repairs later. But in that moment, I lost my temper. I didn't plan anything; it just happened. I struck him, and it was over before I realized what I had done. I panicked for a moment, but I quickly composed myself.

Afterward, I returned to the main hall, trying to act as if nothing had happened. I knew the storm would cover any noise, and I made sure to put everything back in its place. I didn't want anyone to suspect anything was wrong. I was just trying to keep things normal, you know? I had no idea where Chauffeur had gone; I assumed he was still busy in the cottage. I was just trying to maintain order in the chaos of the storm.

Farmer's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the kitchen preparing dinner when the murder happened. I had my hands full with chopping and cooking, and I didn't hear anything unusual over the sound of the rain. I know it might seem odd that I was so focused on my work, but I had a lot on my mind. You see, I’ve been struggling with some financial issues, and I was trying to keep my head down and avoid any trouble. I didn’t want anyone to notice how anxious I was feeling.

I didn’t leave the kitchen until I was called by the others. I was worried about the meal and making sure everything was perfect for the guests. When I finally stepped out, I noticed that everyone was acting strangely, and I felt a knot in my stomach. I had no idea what had happened until I heard about Chauffeur. I couldn’t believe it. I had no reason to harm him; in fact, I thought he was a good lad, always cheerful and light-hearted.

I understand why I might look suspicious, but I assure you, I had no motive. I was just trying to keep my head down and focus on my work. If you want to know who might have had a reason to be upset with Chauffeur, I’d suggest looking at Teacher. He seemed agitated earlier in the evening, and I overheard some tense words exchanged between them. I just want to clear my name and get back to my work without this hanging over me.


Accountant's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the main hall before the murder, mingling with the guests and trying to keep my mind off my financial troubles. I was engaged in conversation with Cook about the menu, and I could hear the laughter and singing from Chauffeur in the background. I felt uneasy, but I tried to maintain my composure, knowing that I couldn’t let anyone see how anxious I was about my gambling debts. I kept glancing toward the door, hoping Chauffeur would come back soon, but I didn’t think much of it at the time.

When the murder happened, I was still in the main hall, surrounded by guests. The storm outside was loud, and I was focused on the conversation with Cook. I didn’t hear anything unusual, and I certainly didn’t see anything suspicious. I was too busy trying to keep my mind off my debts and blend in with the others. I thought it was a good opportunity to distract myself, but I had no idea that something terrible was happening just a short distance away.

After the murder, I noticed that Chauffeur was still missing, and I began to feel more anxious. I tried to act normal, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was very wrong. When the other staff members started to gather, I felt a knot in my stomach. I was worried that my nervousness would make me look guilty, especially with Detective Detecto arriving. I assure you, I had nothing to do with it. I was simply trying to avoid drawing attention to myself because of my debts, which I’ve kept hidden from everyone.


Cook's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the kitchen the whole time, preparing dinner for the guests. I was focused on my work, trying to make sure everything was perfect. The storm outside was loud, and I didn’t hear anything unusual. I was chopping vegetables and stirring pots, completely unaware of what was happening in the cottage. I thought I heard thunder, but I didn’t think much of it. I was just trying to keep my mind on the meal.

When I realized that Chauffeur hadn’t returned, I started to feel anxious. I was worried about how the dinner would go and if the guests would be pleased. I kept glancing toward the door, hoping to see him come back, but he didn’t. I didn’t want to leave the kitchen because I had so much to do, and I thought it would look bad if I abandoned my work. I didn’t know anything was wrong until the other staff members started to gather, and I could see they were worried too.

I know I must have looked suspicious, but I swear I had nothing to do with it. I was just trying to do my job. I’ve been worried about the castle’s finances and my position here, and I didn’t want to draw any attention to myself. I thought about how I could lose my job if the dinner didn’t go well. I didn’t even have a motive to hurt Chauffeur. I just wanted to make a good meal and keep my job.

## Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.
You should use dialog to convey information engage the reader.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point, narrated by Detecto and using dialog where appropriate.

# Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the Gothic castle perched on a cliff, the rainstorm lashing against its ancient stones, and made his way to the cottage where the young chauffeur lay dead on the floor, clearly murdered with a hammer, the scene gruesome with blood spattered across the wooden floorboards. As he surveyed the crime scene, Detecto noted the presence of only four potential suspects: the Accountant, the Teacher, the Cook, and the Farmer, each with their own peculiarities and alibis. 

Detecto began his investigation by questioning the Accountant, who was visibly anxious, his mind seemingly elsewhere. "I was in the main hall with the other guests," the Accountant mumbled, his eyes darting nervously, "engaged in conversation when the murder occurred." Detecto sensed the Accountant's preoccupation with something deeper, perhaps his mounting gambling debts, which seemed to weigh heavily on his conscience. Despite his nervous demeanor, Detecto discerned that the Accountant had access to the hammer in the toolbox, yet there was no indication he had used it.

Next, Detecto turned his attention to the Cook, who was busy in the kitchen, hands covered in flour and food residue. "I was preparing dinner," the Cook recounted, "completely unaware of the events in the cottage." As the Cook shared a humorous anecdote about mistaking salt for sugar in a dessert, Detecto observed the Cook's access to kitchen knives but noted the absence of any weapon that could be linked to the murder.

The Farmer, a stout and nervous man, protested his innocence when questioned. "I was in the castle's kitchen, preparing food for the evening," he insisted, his voice articulate yet tinged with anxiety. Detecto noted the Farmer's access to a shovel from the garden shed, which could be misconstrued as a weapon, but the state of the kitchen, with pots still simmering and ingredients laid out, indicated the Farmer had no time to commit the murder.

Finally, Detecto spoke with the Teacher, who had made his way to the cottage where the Chauffeur was preparing. "When I arrived, he was singing away, completely engrossed in his work," the Teacher explained, his terse manner betraying little emotion. Detecto's keen eye caught the Teacher's subtle unease, and he deduced that the Teacher felt threatened by the Chauffeur's growing influence and feared exposure of his questionable methods, providing a motive for the crime.

As Detecto pieced together the evidence, he recalled the Teacher's admiration for a beautiful tapestry depicting local folklore, a detail that seemed oddly out of place amidst the tension of the evening. Meanwhile, the Accountant complimented the delicious aroma of the roast being prepared, trying to act normal despite his fidgeting and mumbling, which only heightened Detecto's suspicions. The Cook, feeling trapped by Detecto's presence, struggled to maintain composure, their darting glances and fidgeting making them appear suspicious. Similarly, the Farmer's nervous demeanor and mismatched dish towels added an element of eccentricity to his character, yet Detecto remained focused on the facts.

Detecto's investigation led him to conclude that one of these suspects was indeed the murderer, and as he prepared to reveal his findings, he knew exactly who it was.
