# Lighthouse Shadows

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the remote lighthouse, her boots squelching against the rain-soaked ground as she approached the study where Butler lay dead, her elegant form sprawled on the floor, a faint scent of almonds lingering in the airâ€”a telltale sign of poison. The storm outside raged on, its howling winds and crashing waves providing a fitting backdrop to the grim scene within. There were only four people present: Lawyer, Waiter, Musician, and Rabbi, each with their own alibis and secrets, but no one else could possibly have been here. 

Detecto began her investigation, her gravelly voice cutting through the tension as she questioned each suspect, her keen eyes observing every twitch and hesitation. Lawyer, with his drawling manner, claimed he was in the library, engrossed in legal documents, oblivious to the events unfolding in the study. However, Detecto noted the faint chemical stains on his cuff, suggesting his access to the poison through a recent case involving toxic substances. 

Musician, enthusiastic and eager to assist, protested her innocence, insisting she was in the dining room, engaged in lively conversation with the guests. Yet, Detecto's sharp gaze caught the glint of a razor tucked away in her instrument case, a tool she claimed was for tuning, but one that could easily have been used for more sinister purposes. 

Rabbi, absent-minded and squeaky-voiced, recounted his heated discussion with Butler about a charitable donation, his philosophical musings interrupted only by the commotion of her death. Detecto observed his habit of humming old melodies while reading, a quirk that seemed to amuse the library staff but did little to alleviate the suspicion surrounding him. 

Waiter, charming and casual, maintained his innocence, recalling how one of the guests wore a bright yellow tie that reminded him of a banana. Detecto, however, noticed the subtle tremor in his hands and the way his eyes darted nervously, betraying the guilt of a man who had discreetly acquired poison from the kitchen to eliminate a threat to his reputation. 

As the storm continued to batter the lighthouse, Detecto pieced together the fragments of each story, her mind a whirlwind of deductions and possibilities. Lawyer's feigned shock and concern, Musician's eagerness to assist, Rabbi's absent-mindedness, and Waiter's charming facade all swirled in her thoughts, each suspect a potential culprit in the murder of Butler. 

Detecto knew it must be one of these suspects, and as she stood amidst the gathered guests, the truth crystallized in her mind. She was ready to reveal the identity of the killer, but for now, she held her silence, letting the weight of her revelations hang in the air like the storm outside.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Butler?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Lawyer
- B: Musician
- C: Rabbi
- D: Waiter

## Correct Answer

The killer is Waiter

## Reasoning

- [DURING_CRIME]	The lawyer was seen by several guests in the library during the time of the murder, engrossed in his work. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Lawyer)
- [BEFORE_CRIME]	I was in the library before the murder, engrossed in a book on philosophy. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Rabbi)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	Upon learning of Butler's death, Musician was genuinely shocked and distressed. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Musician)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Waiter wanted Butler dead because she had threatened to expose his past misdeeds, which could jeopardize his current position and reputation. He felt cornered and believed that eliminating her would ensure his secrets remained hidden. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Waiter)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using poison, which Waiter had discreetly acquired from the kitchen. He mixed it into Butler's drink, knowing she would be too trusting to suspect anything. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Waiter)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Butler was vulnerable to attack during the evening when she was alone in the study, preparing for a meeting with the other guests. The storm outside created a distraction, making it easier for Waiter to slip in unnoticed. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Waiter)

### Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using poison, which Waiter had discreetly acquired from the kitchen. He mixed it into Butler's drink, knowing she would be too trusting to suspect anything.
Motive: Waiter wanted Butler dead because she had threatened to expose his past misdeeds, which could jeopardize his current position and reputation. He felt cornered and believed that eliminating her would ensure his secrets remained hidden.
Opportunity: Butler was vulnerable to attack during the evening when she was alone in the study, preparing for a meeting with the other guests. The storm outside created a distraction, making it easier for Waiter to slip in unnoticed.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Waiter was busy serving dinner to the guests in the dining room. He moved between tables, charming the patrons with his casual demeanor while keeping an eye on Butler, who was seated in the study, reviewing notes for the evening's discussions. As the storm intensified, the guests became engrossed in their conversations, allowing Waiter to slip away unnoticed.

The murder occurred in the study, where Butler was alone, oblivious to the danger lurking nearby. Waiter entered the room under the pretense of offering her a refill for her drink. He casually poured the poisoned liquid into her glass, ensuring she would not suspect anything amiss. Butler, trusting and unaware, accepted the drink and took a sip, quickly succumbing to the effects of the poison.

Afterward, Waiter returned to the dining room, maintaining his charming facade. He engaged with the guests, laughing and joking, all the while keeping a close watch on the study. When Butler was discovered lifeless, he feigned shock and concern, blending in with the chaos while ensuring no one suspected him of foul play.


Story to Detective: 


I was just doing my job when the storm hit. I was in the dining room, serving dinner and making sure everyone was having a good time. Butler was in the study, preparing for the evening's discussions. I noticed she seemed a bit stressed, but I thought nothing of it. I was focused on my tasks, and honestly, I was just trying to keep the guests happy. I didn't even think about Butler until later.

When I had a moment, I went to check on her. I figured she could use a drink to calm her nerves. I walked into the study, and she was there, looking over her notes. I poured her a drink and made some small talk, trying to lighten the mood. She seemed grateful for the gesture, and I thought I was helping her out. I didnâ€™t think anything was wrong; it was just a drink, after all.

After I left the study, I went back to the dining room and continued serving the guests. I was surprised when the commotion started. I didnâ€™t know what had happened until someone shouted that Butler was unresponsive. I was shocked, of course. I mean, who wouldnâ€™t be? I couldnâ€™t believe it. I was just doing my job, and I had no idea anything was wrong. I swear, I had nothing to do with it.

### Parsed Story for Lawyer

Means: Lawyer had access to the poison used in the murder, as it was part of a legal case involving toxic substances.
Motive: None. Lawyer did not want Butler dead, but their past relationship makes them look suspicious.
Opportunity: Lawyer was in the library, engrossed in a legal document, when the murder occurred, making them unaware of Butler's vulnerability.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Lawyer was in the library, reviewing legal documents related to a case involving toxic substances. He was focused on his work, occasionally glancing out the window at the stormy weather, which seemed to match his mood. He had a history with Butler, having once been romantically involved with her, but their relationship had soured, leading to a strained friendship. Despite this, he had no desire to harm her; he simply wanted to move on from their past.

When the murder occurred, Lawyer remained in the library, completely absorbed in his documents. The sound of the storm outside masked any noise that might have come from the study. He was unaware that Butler was in danger, as he was too preoccupied with his work to notice the time passing or the absence of the Waiter. The atmosphere in the lighthouse was tense, but Lawyer was oblivious to the unfolding drama.

After the murder was discovered, Lawyer rushed out of the library, alarmed by the commotion. He joined the other guests in the dining room, where he feigned shock and concern upon hearing about Butler's death. He tried to gather information from the other guests, hoping to piece together what had happened, while also trying to distance himself from any suspicion. His laid-back demeanor, however, made him appear nonchalant, which only added to the growing doubts about his innocence.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was in the library before the murder, deeply engrossed in reviewing legal documents for a case. I was unaware of what was happening in the study, as the storm outside was quite loud, and I was focused on my work. I had no reason to leave the library, especially since I was trying to prepare for an important meeting with clients the following week.

When I heard the commotion after Butler was found dead, I immediately left the library to see what was happening. I was shocked to learn about her death, and I joined the others in the dining room to gather information. I was genuinely concerned and wanted to help, but I realize now that my calm demeanor may have come off as suspicious. I had no motive to harm Butler; our relationship had ended on bad terms, but I would never wish her dead.

I also pointed out that the Waiter had been acting strangely throughout the evening. He was overly charming, almost too much so, and I noticed he had been keeping a close eye on Butler. I felt it was important to mention this because I believe he may have had a motive to harm her, unlike me. I just want to clear my name and help find the real killer.


### Parsed Story for Rabbi

Means: None. Rabbi had no access to poison or any other weapon; he was in the library, where he had been reading.
Motive: None. Rabbi valued Butler's friendship and was upset about the argument, but he would never wish her harm.
Opportunity: None. Rabbi was in the library during the murder, engrossed in a book, and did not leave the room.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Rabbi was in the library, thumbing through a collection of old texts on philosophy. He had been invited to the gathering at the lighthouse to discuss various community issues, but he found himself distracted by the storm outside and the weight of his own thoughts. Earlier in the evening, he had a heated discussion with Butler regarding a charitable donation she had promised to make, which had left him feeling unsettled. However, he had no intention of harming her; he simply wanted to express his disappointment.

When the murder occurred, Rabbi remained in the library, completely absorbed in his reading. The storm outside raged on, and the sound of the wind and rain drowned out any noise that might have come from the study. He was unaware that Butler was in danger, as he had not left the library since their earlier conversation. His absent-minded nature kept him focused on the pages in front of him, oblivious to the passing time and the unfolding drama in the rest of the lighthouse.

After the murder was discovered, Rabbi was startled by the commotion coming from the dining room. He hurried out of the library, still clutching the book he had been reading, and joined the other guests in the dining room. Upon hearing about Butler's death, he was genuinely shocked and distressed. He tried to piece together what had happened, but his absent-mindedness made him seem more confused than concerned, leading others to view him with suspicion.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been in the library before the murder, engrossed in a book on philosophy. I had no intention of leaving the library, especially after my earlier argument with Butler about her charitable donation. I was upset about our discussion, but I would never wish her harm. I was simply trying to understand the complexities of human nature through my reading, which is why I didnâ€™t notice the time passing.

When I heard the commotion after Butler was discovered dead, I was startled and rushed out of the library. I was still holding the book I had been reading, which might have made me appear suspicious. I joined the others in the dining room, genuinely shocked and distressed by the news. I tried to gather information about what had happened, but my absent-mindedness may have made me seem more confused than concerned, which was not my intention.

I want to emphasize that I had no motive to harm Butler. Our argument was simply a disagreement, and I valued her friendship. I believe that Waiter, who was charming and attentive, may have had more opportunity to slip away unnoticed than I did. I hope you can see that I was not involved in any foul play.


### Parsed Story for Musician

Means: Musician had access to the razor, which was used for tuning her instruments.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Musician was in the dining room, engaged in conversation with other guests, during the time of the murder.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Musician was in the dining room, enthusiastically discussing her latest compositions with the other guests. She was trying to impress them with her musical knowledge and skills, but her underlying anxiety about performing in front of such a distinguished group made her overly animated. She frequently glanced toward the study, where Butler was seated, feeling a mix of admiration and intimidation. Musician had hoped to gain Butler's approval, as she had always looked up to her as a mentor figure.

When the murder occurred, Musician remained in the dining room, completely unaware of the events unfolding in the study. The storm outside created a cacophony of noise, drowning out any sounds that might have come from Butler's demise. Musician was engaged in a lively debate about music theory with Lawyer and Rabbi, and their animated conversation kept her distracted from the passing time. She felt a sense of camaraderie with the guests, which made her oblivious to the danger lurking just a few rooms away.

After the murder was discovered, Musician was one of the first to react, rushing to the study with the others to see what had happened. Upon learning of Butler's death, she was genuinely shocked and distressed, her enthusiasm replaced by confusion and fear. In the chaos that ensued, Musician tried to help by offering to play a calming tune on her instrument, hoping to ease the tension in the room. However, her eagerness to assist only made her seem more suspicious, as others began to question her presence and actions during the critical moments leading up to the murder.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the dining room before the murder, excitedly discussing my latest compositions with the guests. I wanted to impress everyone, especially Butler, who I admired greatly. I was so caught up in the conversation that I didnâ€™t notice how much time had passed or that Butler was alone in the study. I was trying to distract myself from my stage fright, and I thought that engaging with the others would help me feel more confident.

When the murder happened, I was still in the dining room, completely unaware of what was going on in the study. The storm outside was so loud that I couldnâ€™t hear anything else. I was talking to Lawyer and Rabbi about music theory, and we were all animatedly debating when the commotion started. I didnâ€™t even realize something was wrong until everyone started rushing toward the study, and I felt a wave of panic wash over me.

After we found out about Butler's death, I was in shock. I rushed to the study with the others, and when I learned what had happened, I felt devastated. I wanted to help, so I suggested playing a calming tune to ease the tension in the room. I didnâ€™t mean to draw attention to myself, but I could see that my eagerness to assist made me look suspicious. I just wanted to show that I cared and was there for everyone during this terrible time.

It Takes Place In: Remote lighthouse and a few buildings on a stormy coast
The Crime Happened In: Study
Other Locations in the Story: Dining Room, Library

The Murder Weapon: Poison
Other Suspicious Items: Razor

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Poison in the Study by Waiter, killing Butler. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In the storm-lashed confines of a remote lighthouse, Butler, an elegant elderly woman, is found dead under mysterious circumstances. Detective Detecto must navigate a web of intrigue, secrets, and eerie happenings to unmask the killer among a colorful cast of suspects.

Waiter's Story to the Detective: 


I was just doing my job when the storm hit. I was in the dining room, serving dinner and making sure everyone was having a good time. Butler was in the study, preparing for the evening's discussions. I noticed she seemed a bit stressed, but I thought nothing of it. I was focused on my tasks, and honestly, I was just trying to keep the guests happy. I didn't even think about Butler until later.

When I had a moment, I went to check on her. I figured she could use a drink to calm her nerves. I walked into the study, and she was there, looking over her notes. I poured her a drink and made some small talk, trying to lighten the mood. She seemed grateful for the gesture, and I thought I was helping her out. I didnâ€™t think anything was wrong; it was just a drink, after all.

After I left the study, I went back to the dining room and continued serving the guests. I was surprised when the commotion started. I didnâ€™t know what had happened until someone shouted that Butler was unresponsive. I was shocked, of course. I mean, who wouldnâ€™t be? I couldnâ€™t believe it. I was just doing my job, and I had no idea anything was wrong. I swear, I had nothing to do with it.

Lawyer's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was in the library before the murder, deeply engrossed in reviewing legal documents for a case. I was unaware of what was happening in the study, as the storm outside was quite loud, and I was focused on my work. I had no reason to leave the library, especially since I was trying to prepare for an important meeting with clients the following week.

When I heard the commotion after Butler was found dead, I immediately left the library to see what was happening. I was shocked to learn about her death, and I joined the others in the dining room to gather information. I was genuinely concerned and wanted to help, but I realize now that my calm demeanor may have come off as suspicious. I had no motive to harm Butler; our relationship had ended on bad terms, but I would never wish her dead.

I also pointed out that the Waiter had been acting strangely throughout the evening. He was overly charming, almost too much so, and I noticed he had been keeping a close eye on Butler. I felt it was important to mention this because I believe he may have had a motive to harm her, unlike me. I just want to clear my name and help find the real killer.


Rabbi's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I had been in the library before the murder, engrossed in a book on philosophy. I had no intention of leaving the library, especially after my earlier argument with Butler about her charitable donation. I was upset about our discussion, but I would never wish her harm. I was simply trying to understand the complexities of human nature through my reading, which is why I didnâ€™t notice the time passing.

When I heard the commotion after Butler was discovered dead, I was startled and rushed out of the library. I was still holding the book I had been reading, which might have made me appear suspicious. I joined the others in the dining room, genuinely shocked and distressed by the news. I tried to gather information about what had happened, but my absent-mindedness may have made me seem more confused than concerned, which was not my intention.

I want to emphasize that I had no motive to harm Butler. Our argument was simply a disagreement, and I valued her friendship. I believe that Waiter, who was charming and attentive, may have had more opportunity to slip away unnoticed than I did. I hope you can see that I was not involved in any foul play.


Musician's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the dining room before the murder, excitedly discussing my latest compositions with the guests. I wanted to impress everyone, especially Butler, who I admired greatly. I was so caught up in the conversation that I didnâ€™t notice how much time had passed or that Butler was alone in the study. I was trying to distract myself from my stage fright, and I thought that engaging with the others would help me feel more confident.

When the murder happened, I was still in the dining room, completely unaware of what was going on in the study. The storm outside was so loud that I couldnâ€™t hear anything else. I was talking to Lawyer and Rabbi about music theory, and we were all animatedly debating when the commotion started. I didnâ€™t even realize something was wrong until everyone started rushing toward the study, and I felt a wave of panic wash over me.

After we found out about Butler's death, I was in shock. I rushed to the study with the others, and when I learned what had happened, I felt devastated. I wanted to help, so I suggested playing a calming tune to ease the tension in the room. I didnâ€™t mean to draw attention to myself, but I could see that my eagerness to assist made me look suspicious. I just wanted to show that I cared and was there for everyone during this terrible time.

- Narrator:	It must be one of these suspects, and Detecto knows just who it is.

#### Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point.

### Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the remote lighthouse, her boots squelching against the rain-soaked ground as she approached the study where Butler lay dead, her elegant form sprawled on the floor, a faint scent of almonds lingering in the airâ€”a telltale sign of poison. The storm outside raged on, its howling winds and crashing waves providing a fitting backdrop to the grim scene within. There were only four people present: Lawyer, Waiter, Musician, and Rabbi, each with their own alibis and secrets, but no one else could possibly have been here. 

Detecto began her investigation, her gravelly voice cutting through the tension as she questioned each suspect, her keen eyes observing every twitch and hesitation. Lawyer, with his drawling manner, claimed he was in the library, engrossed in legal documents, oblivious to the events unfolding in the study. However, Detecto noted the faint chemical stains on his cuff, suggesting his access to the poison through a recent case involving toxic substances. 

Musician, enthusiastic and eager to assist, protested her innocence, insisting she was in the dining room, engaged in lively conversation with the guests. Yet, Detecto's sharp gaze caught the glint of a razor tucked away in her instrument case, a tool she claimed was for tuning, but one that could easily have been used for more sinister purposes. 

Rabbi, absent-minded and squeaky-voiced, recounted his heated discussion with Butler about a charitable donation, his philosophical musings interrupted only by the commotion of her death. Detecto observed his habit of humming old melodies while reading, a quirk that seemed to amuse the library staff but did little to alleviate the suspicion surrounding him. 

Waiter, charming and casual, maintained his innocence, recalling how one of the guests wore a bright yellow tie that reminded him of a banana. Detecto, however, noticed the subtle tremor in his hands and the way his eyes darted nervously, betraying the guilt of a man who had discreetly acquired poison from the kitchen to eliminate a threat to his reputation. 

As the storm continued to batter the lighthouse, Detecto pieced together the fragments of each story, her mind a whirlwind of deductions and possibilities. Lawyer's feigned shock and concern, Musician's eagerness to assist, Rabbi's absent-mindedness, and Waiter's charming facade all swirled in her thoughts, each suspect a potential culprit in the murder of Butler. 

Detecto knew it must be one of these suspects, and as she stood amidst the gathered guests, the truth crystallized in her mind. She was ready to reveal the identity of the killer, but for now, she held her silence, letting the weight of her revelations hang in the air like the storm outside.
