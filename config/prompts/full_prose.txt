I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

# Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

# Outline

Now, here's the outline of the story that I have. I want you to follow this outline strictly, but I want you to convert it into prose.

{outline}

# Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters. Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline.
