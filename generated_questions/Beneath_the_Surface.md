# Beneath the Surface

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the sealed underground bunker, his squeaky voice echoing as he announced his presence at the scene of the crime. The victim, Butcher, lay lifeless on the office floor, a shovel nearby stained with the unmistakable evidence of its deadly use. Only four people could have been involved: Actor, Shopkeeper, Journalist, and Guard, each with their own alibis and secrets. Detecto began his investigation, keenly observing the tension in the air and the subtle cues each suspect gave away.

Actor, with a monotone voice, insisted on his innocence, claiming he was in the workshop rehearsing lines, a favorite mug in hand, oblivious to the murder. Detecto noted the screwdriver Actor had been using, though Actor assured it was merely for fixing a prop, not for harm. As Actor spoke, Detecto observed a spider spinning a web in the workshop, a detail Actor mentioned as a sign of good luck, which seemed to calm his nerves. Guard, terse yet friendly, admitted seeing Shopkeeper in the workshop earlier, a pang of jealousy evident in her voice as she spoke of his relationship with Butcher.

Guard protested her innocence, explaining she was on patrol during the murder, humming her favorite tune, and had no access to the shovel. Detecto noticed her eyes linger on a colorful poster of a cat wearing sunglasses, a moment of levity amidst the tension. Journalist, enthusiastic yet awkward, claimed to be working on a story about the bunker's construction, her demeanor overly eager as she protested her innocence. Detecto's keen eye caught the way Journalist's hands trembled slightly when she mentioned Butcher, a sign of deeper emotions at play.

Shopkeeper, articulate and charming, insisted he had no access to weapons or tools that could have been used in the murder, his words carefully chosen. Detecto sensed a hidden layer to Shopkeeper's story, as he spoke of organizing supplies in the workshop during the murder. Guard, with a hint of unease, suggested that Journalist's strange behavior might be linked to the crime, her own feelings for Shopkeeper complicating her perspective. As the fluorescent lights flickered, Guard found comfort in their rhythm, a small solace in the midst of chaos.

Detecto pieced together the clues, noting Actor's observation of the tense atmosphere and his lack of motive to harm Butcher. Guard's unease about her feelings for Shopkeeper and her suggestion about Journalist's involvement added another layer to the mystery. Detecto's mind raced with possibilities, each suspect's story weaving a complex web of intrigue. As he prepared to reveal his conclusion, Detecto knew the truth was within reach, hidden just beneath the surface of their words and actions.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Butcher?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Journalist
- B: Shopkeeper
- C: Actor
- D: Guard

## Correct Answer

The killer is Journalist

## Reasoning

- [BEFORE_CRIME]	I pointed out that I had no access to any weapons or tools that could have been used in the murder. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Shopkeeper)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	I want to emphasize that I had no motive to harm Butcher. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Actor)
- [DURING_CRIME]	The guard did not have access to the murder weapon, the shovel, during the time of the murder. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Guard)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Journalist wanted Butcher dead because she believed Butcher was hiding a secret that could ruin her career. Journalist had uncovered information suggesting that Butcher was involved in illegal activities related to the meat trade, and she felt that exposing this would be her ticket to fame. However, Butcher had threatened to reveal Journalist's own past mistakes, which would jeopardize her aspirations. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Journalist)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a shovel, which was found in the office. Journalist had taken the shovel from the workshop earlier that day, intending to use it for a story about the bunkerâ€™s construction. It was a heavy tool that could easily cause fatal harm. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Journalist)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Butcher was vulnerable to attack when she was alone in her office, reviewing documents related to her business. The bunker was sealed, and the other characters were preoccupied with their own tasks, giving Journalist the perfect chance to confront Butcher without interruption. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Journalist)

### Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a shovel, which was found in the office. Journalist had taken the shovel from the workshop earlier that day, intending to use it for a story about the bunkerâ€™s construction. It was a heavy tool that could easily cause fatal harm.
Motive: Journalist wanted Butcher dead because she believed Butcher was hiding a secret that could ruin her career. Journalist had uncovered information suggesting that Butcher was involved in illegal activities related to the meat trade, and she felt that exposing this would be her ticket to fame. However, Butcher had threatened to reveal Journalist's own past mistakes, which would jeopardize her aspirations.
Opportunity: Butcher was vulnerable to attack when she was alone in her office, reviewing documents related to her business. The bunker was sealed, and the other characters were preoccupied with their own tasks, giving Journalist the perfect chance to confront Butcher without interruption.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Journalist was in the workshop, pretending to work on a story about the bunkerâ€™s construction. She had been observing Butcher from a distance, waiting for the right moment to confront her about the secrets she believed Butcher was hiding. Journalist felt a mix of excitement and anxiety, knowing that this confrontation could change her life forever. She had taken the shovel under the pretense of needing it for her article, but her true intentions were far more sinister.

The murder occurred in Butcher's office, a small, cluttered space filled with papers and meat industry paraphernalia. When Journalist entered, Butcher was seated at her desk, unaware of the impending danger. Journalist approached her with a friendly demeanor, but as the conversation turned to the secrets of the meat trade, the atmosphere shifted. In a sudden moment of rage and desperation, Journalist struck Butcher with the shovel, catching her off guard and delivering a fatal blow.

After the murder, Journalist quickly composed herself, realizing the gravity of what she had done. She left the office, placing the shovel back in the workshop to avoid suspicion. Journalist then returned to the main area of the bunker, acting as if nothing had happened. She mingled with the other characters, feigning interest in their conversations while her mind raced with thoughts of how to cover her tracks and avoid being implicated in Butcher's death.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the workshop earlier, working on a story about the bunkerâ€™s construction. I had taken a shovel for research purposes, thinking it would add a unique angle to my article. I was excited about the project and wanted to make sure I had all the right details. Butcher had been in the office, and I thought it would be a good opportunity to ask her a few questions about her business. I didnâ€™t think anything was wrong with that; I was just trying to gather information.

When I entered Butcher's office, she was busy with her papers, and I approached her with a friendly demeanor. We started discussing the meat trade, and I could sense that she was hiding something. I asked her about her practices, but she became defensive. I felt a rush of frustration because I knew she was keeping secrets that could ruin my career. I didnâ€™t mean for things to escalate, but the conversation took a turn, and I lost my composure for a moment. It was all so overwhelming, and I just wanted to get the truth.

Afterward, I left the office and returned to the main area of the bunker. I was shaken but tried to act normal, as if nothing had happened. I didnâ€™t want anyone to suspect me, so I joined the others and engaged in their conversations. I thought about how I could still write my article and make a name for myself without Butcherâ€™s interference. I was just focused on my work and didnâ€™t think anyone would believe I could do something like that.

### Parsed Story for Shopkeeper

Means: None
Motive: None
Opportunity: Shopkeeper was in the workshop, organizing supplies, when the murder occurred.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Shopkeeper was busy in the workshop, sorting through various supplies and tools. He was focused on his task, trying to keep his mind off the tension in the bunker. Shopkeeper had been feeling anxious about his secret relationship with Butcher, which he had kept hidden from the others. He was worried that if anyone found out, it would ruin his reputation and the trust he had built with the other characters in the bunker.

When the murder occurred, Shopkeeper was still in the workshop, unaware of the chaos unfolding in Butcher's office. He had been preoccupied with his work and did not hear the commotion. The sounds of the shovel striking and Butcher's gasp were drowned out by the clanging of metal tools and the rustling of papers. Shopkeeper had no idea that a crime was being committed just a few rooms away.

After the murder, Shopkeeper left the workshop to find the others, hoping to join in their conversations and distract himself from his worries. He noticed that the atmosphere had shifted, with everyone appearing tense and on edge. Shopkeeper tried to engage with the group, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something terrible had happened. He felt a growing sense of dread as he realized that Butcher was missing, and he began to worry that his secret relationship might come to light in the midst of the chaos.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was in the workshop before the murder, organizing supplies and tools. I was completely focused on my work and didn't hear anything unusual happening in Butcher's office. I had no reason to be near her at that moment, as I was preoccupied with my tasks. I emphasized that I was unaware of any danger until I noticed the change in atmosphere when I left the workshop.

I also mentioned that I had a close relationship with Butcher, but it was purely professional and based on mutual respect. I expressed my concern that others might misinterpret our friendship, especially given the circumstances. I wanted to assure the detective that I had no motive to harm Butcher, as I valued our connection and would never jeopardize it.

Finally, I pointed out that I had no access to any weapons or tools that could have been used in the murder. I was in the workshop, surrounded by harmless items, and I had no opportunity to commit such a crime. I suggested that Detective Detecto should consider the actions of others, particularly the Journalist, who seemed overly eager to engage with everyone after the incident.


### Parsed Story for Actor

Means: Actor had access to a screwdriver, which he was using to fix a prop for an upcoming performance. However, he had no intention of using it for harm.
Motive: None. Actor did not want Butcher dead; he was merely seeking financial help.
Opportunity: Actor was rehearsing lines in the workshop, making noise that would have masked any sounds from Butcher's office.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Actor was in the workshop, rehearsing lines for an upcoming performance. He was focused on his script, pacing back and forth as he practiced his delivery. The workshop was filled with various props and tools, and Actor was using a screwdriver to make adjustments to one of the items. He was unaware of the tension building in the bunker, as he was preoccupied with his performance and the financial troubles that weighed heavily on his mind.

When the murder occurred, Actor was still in the workshop, engrossed in his rehearsal. The sounds of his voice echoed off the walls, drowning out any noise that might have come from Butcher's office. He was completely oblivious to the chaos unfolding just a few rooms away, as he continued to practice his lines, lost in his own world. The workshop door was closed, and he had no idea that Butcher was in danger.

After the murder, Actor finished his rehearsal and stepped out of the workshop, feeling satisfied with his performance. He noticed a strange atmosphere among the other characters, who seemed tense and anxious. Actor approached them, trying to engage in conversation, but he quickly realized that something was amiss. When he learned that Butcher was missing, he felt a wave of panic wash over him, fearing that his financial troubles might be exposed amid the chaos. He tried to act normal, but his nervousness only added to the suspicion surrounding him.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the workshop rehearsing lines for my performance when the murder took place. I was completely focused on my script and making adjustments to a prop with a screwdriver. I had no idea that anything was happening in Butcher's office, as I was making enough noise with my rehearsing that I couldn't hear anything else. I was just trying to prepare for my role, and my mind was consumed with my performance and my financial troubles.

When I finished rehearsing, I stepped out of the workshop and immediately sensed that something was wrong. The atmosphere was tense, and the other characters seemed on edge. I approached them, hoping to engage in conversation, but it was clear that something terrible had happened. I felt a growing sense of dread when I learned that Butcher was missing, and I feared that my own financial issues might come to light in the midst of this chaos.

I want to emphasize that I had no motive to harm Butcher. I was actually seeking her help with my financial troubles, hoping to secure a loan from her. I know that my actions may seem suspicious, but I assure you that I was simply rehearsing and had no idea of the murder until after it happened. I believe that Journalist, who was acting strangely, might have something to do with this incident. She seemed overly interested in Butcher and was lurking around the workshop earlier.


### Parsed Story for Guard

Means: Guard has access to a variety of tools in the bunker, including a baton she uses for her security duties, but she did not use it.
Motive: Guard has no motive to kill Butcher; she is simply concerned about her feelings for Shopkeeper and the potential fallout from the relationship.
Opportunity: Guard was patrolling the bunker when the murder occurred, making her unable to attack Butcher.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Guard was on her regular patrol of the bunker, ensuring that everything was secure and that no one was in danger. She had been feeling uneasy about the atmosphere in the bunker, especially with the tension between the characters. During her patrol, she noticed Shopkeeper working in the workshop and felt a pang of jealousy as she thought about his secret relationship with Butcher. Guard tried to shake off her feelings and focused on her duties, but the thought lingered in her mind.

When the murder occurred, Guard was making her way down the corridor, checking doors and ensuring that no one was in restricted areas. She was unaware of the chaos unfolding in Butcher's office, as she was focused on her responsibilities. The sounds of the shovel striking and Butcher's gasp were muffled by the walls, and Guard continued her patrol, oblivious to the danger just a few rooms away. She had no idea that her feelings for Shopkeeper would soon complicate her situation.

After the murder, Guard returned to the main area of the bunker, where she immediately sensed the change in atmosphere. The other characters were tense and anxious, and she felt a knot in her stomach as she realized something terrible had happened. Guard tried to engage with the others, but her unease made her seem distant. She noticed Shopkeeper looking worried, and her heart raced as she feared that their secret might come to light. Guard's behavior, combined with her patrol during the time of the murder, made her seem suspicious to the others, even though she was innocent.


Story to Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was on my regular patrol when the murder happened. I was checking doors and ensuring that everything was secure in the bunker. I had no idea that anything was happening in Butcher's office, as I was focused on my duties. I mentioned that I had seen Shopkeeper in the workshop earlier, but I didn't think much of it at the time. I was just doing my job, and I didn't hear anything unusual while I was patrolling.

I also expressed my concern about the atmosphere in the bunker. I noticed that everyone seemed tense, and I felt a growing sense of dread as I returned to the main area. I tried to engage with the others, but I could tell something was wrong. I mentioned that I had been feeling uneasy about my feelings for Shopkeeper, especially since I thought he might be involved with Butcher. I worried that my jealousy could be misconstrued as a motive, but I assured the detective that I would never harm anyone.

Finally, I pointed out that I had no means to commit the murder. I was on patrol, and I didn't have access to any weapons at that time. I suggested that perhaps Journalist, who had been acting strangely, might have had something to do with it. I felt that my innocence was being questioned, but I was confident that the detective would see the truth once he gathered all the evidence.

It Takes Place In: Sealed underground bunker
The Crime Happened In: Office
Other Locations in the Story: Workshop, Manor

The Murder Weapon: Shovel
Other Suspicious Items: Screwdriver

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Shovel in the Office by Journalist, killing Butcher. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In an underground bunker, a butcher's death at the hands of a journalist sets off a chain of mysteries. With eccentric characters and suspicious items adding to the intrigue, it's up to the young Detective Detecto to unravel the truth hidden beneath the surface.

Journalist's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the workshop earlier, working on a story about the bunkerâ€™s construction. I had taken a shovel for research purposes, thinking it would add a unique angle to my article. I was excited about the project and wanted to make sure I had all the right details. Butcher had been in the office, and I thought it would be a good opportunity to ask her a few questions about her business. I didnâ€™t think anything was wrong with that; I was just trying to gather information.

When I entered Butcher's office, she was busy with her papers, and I approached her with a friendly demeanor. We started discussing the meat trade, and I could sense that she was hiding something. I asked her about her practices, but she became defensive. I felt a rush of frustration because I knew she was keeping secrets that could ruin my career. I didnâ€™t mean for things to escalate, but the conversation took a turn, and I lost my composure for a moment. It was all so overwhelming, and I just wanted to get the truth.

Afterward, I left the office and returned to the main area of the bunker. I was shaken but tried to act normal, as if nothing had happened. I didnâ€™t want anyone to suspect me, so I joined the others and engaged in their conversations. I thought about how I could still write my article and make a name for myself without Butcherâ€™s interference. I was just focused on my work and didnâ€™t think anyone would believe I could do something like that.

Shopkeeper's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was in the workshop before the murder, organizing supplies and tools. I was completely focused on my work and didn't hear anything unusual happening in Butcher's office. I had no reason to be near her at that moment, as I was preoccupied with my tasks. I emphasized that I was unaware of any danger until I noticed the change in atmosphere when I left the workshop.

I also mentioned that I had a close relationship with Butcher, but it was purely professional and based on mutual respect. I expressed my concern that others might misinterpret our friendship, especially given the circumstances. I wanted to assure the detective that I had no motive to harm Butcher, as I valued our connection and would never jeopardize it.

Finally, I pointed out that I had no access to any weapons or tools that could have been used in the murder. I was in the workshop, surrounded by harmless items, and I had no opportunity to commit such a crime. I suggested that Detective Detecto should consider the actions of others, particularly the Journalist, who seemed overly eager to engage with everyone after the incident.


Actor's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the workshop rehearsing lines for my performance when the murder took place. I was completely focused on my script and making adjustments to a prop with a screwdriver. I had no idea that anything was happening in Butcher's office, as I was making enough noise with my rehearsing that I couldn't hear anything else. I was just trying to prepare for my role, and my mind was consumed with my performance and my financial troubles.

When I finished rehearsing, I stepped out of the workshop and immediately sensed that something was wrong. The atmosphere was tense, and the other characters seemed on edge. I approached them, hoping to engage in conversation, but it was clear that something terrible had happened. I felt a growing sense of dread when I learned that Butcher was missing, and I feared that my own financial issues might come to light in the midst of this chaos.

I want to emphasize that I had no motive to harm Butcher. I was actually seeking her help with my financial troubles, hoping to secure a loan from her. I know that my actions may seem suspicious, but I assure you that I was simply rehearsing and had no idea of the murder until after it happened. I believe that Journalist, who was acting strangely, might have something to do with this incident. She seemed overly interested in Butcher and was lurking around the workshop earlier.


Guard's Story to the Detective: 


In my interview with Detective Detecto, I explained that I was on my regular patrol when the murder happened. I was checking doors and ensuring that everything was secure in the bunker. I had no idea that anything was happening in Butcher's office, as I was focused on my duties. I mentioned that I had seen Shopkeeper in the workshop earlier, but I didn't think much of it at the time. I was just doing my job, and I didn't hear anything unusual while I was patrolling.

I also expressed my concern about the atmosphere in the bunker. I noticed that everyone seemed tense, and I felt a growing sense of dread as I returned to the main area. I tried to engage with the others, but I could tell something was wrong. I mentioned that I had been feeling uneasy about my feelings for Shopkeeper, especially since I thought he might be involved with Butcher. I worried that my jealousy could be misconstrued as a motive, but I assured the detective that I would never harm anyone.

Finally, I pointed out that I had no means to commit the murder. I was on patrol, and I didn't have access to any weapons at that time. I suggested that perhaps Journalist, who had been acting strangely, might have had something to do with it. I felt that my innocence was being questioned, but I was confident that the detective would see the truth once he gathered all the evidence.

#### Outline

Now, here's the outline of the story that I have. I want you to follow this outline strictly, but I want you to convert it into prose.

- Narrator:	The setting: Sealed underground bunker. The victim, Butcher, lies dead on the floor in the Office! They were clearly murdered with Shovel (describe blood, etc).
- Narrator:	Detective Detecto arrives at the scene of the crime. (Detecto is a 19-year-old man, short and friendly, who speaks in a squeaky manner)
- Narrator:	There are only 4 people present: Actor, Shopkeeper, Journalist, Guard. No one else could possibly have been here.
- Narrator:	The detective begins to poke around and ask questions. And this is what the detective learns, from clues and from talking to the people present:
- Actor (concealed from detective):	Actor was rehearsing lines in the workshop, making noise that would have masked any sounds from Butcher's office.
- Actor (concealed from detective):	Actor had access to a screwdriver, which he was using to fix a prop for an upcoming performance. However, he had no intention of using it for harm.

- Actor:	Actor protests that they are innocent.
- Actor:	While rehearsing, Actor noticed a spider spinning a web in the corner of the workshop and thought it was a sign of good luck.

- Guard (concealed from detective):	Guard has access to a variety of tools in the bunker, including a baton she uses for her security duties, but she did not use it.
- Guard (concealed from detective):	Guard has no motive to kill Butcher; she is simply concerned about her feelings for Shopkeeper and the potential fallout from the relationship.

- Guard (concealed from detective):	Guard was patrolling the bunker when the murder occurred, making her unable to attack Butcher.
- Guard:	Guard often hummed her favorite tune while patrolling, a catchy jingle that always made her smile.
- Guard:	As she walked past the workshop, Guard noticed a colorful poster of a cat wearing sunglasses, which made her chuckle.
- Journalist (concealed from detective):	Journalist wanted Butcher dead because she believed Butcher was hiding a secret that could ruin her career.

- Narrator:	It must be one of these suspects, and Detecto knows just who it is.

#### Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.
You may use dialog to convey information engage the reader.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point.

### Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the sealed underground bunker, his squeaky voice echoing as he announced his presence at the scene of the crime. The victim, Butcher, lay lifeless on the office floor, a shovel nearby stained with the unmistakable evidence of its deadly use. Only four people could have been involved: Actor, Shopkeeper, Journalist, and Guard, each with their own alibis and secrets. Detecto began his investigation, keenly observing the tension in the air and the subtle cues each suspect gave away.

Actor, with a monotone voice, insisted on his innocence, claiming he was in the workshop rehearsing lines, a favorite mug in hand, oblivious to the murder. Detecto noted the screwdriver Actor had been using, though Actor assured it was merely for fixing a prop, not for harm. As Actor spoke, Detecto observed a spider spinning a web in the workshop, a detail Actor mentioned as a sign of good luck, which seemed to calm his nerves. Guard, terse yet friendly, admitted seeing Shopkeeper in the workshop earlier, a pang of jealousy evident in her voice as she spoke of his relationship with Butcher.

Guard protested her innocence, explaining she was on patrol during the murder, humming her favorite tune, and had no access to the shovel. Detecto noticed her eyes linger on a colorful poster of a cat wearing sunglasses, a moment of levity amidst the tension. Journalist, enthusiastic yet awkward, claimed to be working on a story about the bunker's construction, her demeanor overly eager as she protested her innocence. Detecto's keen eye caught the way Journalist's hands trembled slightly when she mentioned Butcher, a sign of deeper emotions at play.

Shopkeeper, articulate and charming, insisted he had no access to weapons or tools that could have been used in the murder, his words carefully chosen. Detecto sensed a hidden layer to Shopkeeper's story, as he spoke of organizing supplies in the workshop during the murder. Guard, with a hint of unease, suggested that Journalist's strange behavior might be linked to the crime, her own feelings for Shopkeeper complicating her perspective. As the fluorescent lights flickered, Guard found comfort in their rhythm, a small solace in the midst of chaos.

Detecto pieced together the clues, noting Actor's observation of the tense atmosphere and his lack of motive to harm Butcher. Guard's unease about her feelings for Shopkeeper and her suggestion about Journalist's involvement added another layer to the mystery. Detecto's mind raced with possibilities, each suspect's story weaving a complex web of intrigue. As he prepared to reveal his conclusion, Detecto knew the truth was within reach, hidden just beneath the surface of their words and actions.
