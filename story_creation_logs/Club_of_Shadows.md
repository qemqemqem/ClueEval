# Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a hammer, which was a tool commonly found in the office for various maintenance tasks. It was an item that could easily be overlooked as a potential weapon.
Motive: Lawyer wanted Chauffeur dead because he had discovered sensitive information about her dealings with a client that could jeopardize her career and reputation. The Chauffeur had been overheard discussing this information with others, and Lawyer feared that if it became public, it would ruin her standing in the exclusive club and the legal community.
Opportunity: Chauffeur was vulnerable to attack when he was alone in the office, reviewing documents late at night. The club was quiet at that hour, and the lack of witnesses provided the perfect chance for Lawyer to confront him without interruption.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Lawyer and Chauffeur had a seemingly cordial conversation in the lounge area of the exclusive club. They discussed mundane topics, but underlying tensions simmered beneath the surface. Chauffeur had been growing increasingly bold in his inquiries about Lawyer's business dealings, hinting that he knew more than he should. After their conversation, Chauffeur retreated to the office to sort through some papers, leaving Lawyer to contemplate her next move.

When the clock struck ten, the club was nearly deserted. Lawyer made her way to the office, where she found Chauffeur engrossed in his work, oblivious to her approach. The door was slightly ajar, allowing her to slip in unnoticed. In a sudden moment of desperation, she seized the hammer from the desk, a tool she had seen earlier while discussing repairs with the maintenance staff. With a swift and calculated motion, she struck Chauffeur, ensuring that he would not have the chance to reveal her secrets.

After the deed was done, Lawyer quickly composed herself. She placed the hammer back on the desk, making it appear as though it had been there all along. She then exited the office, closing the door quietly behind her. To any onlookers, she would appear as if she had simply been enjoying the club's amenities. In the following hours, she mingled with other members, feigning ignorance of the chaos that would soon unfold, all while maintaining her laid-back demeanor.


Story to Detective: 


As I sit here recounting the events of that fateful evening, I must express my utter disbelief at the notion that I could be implicated in such a heinous act. Chauffeur and I had a professional relationship, one that was built on mutual respect, or so I thought. Yes, he had been probing into my affairs, but I dismissed it as mere curiosity. I had no reason to believe he would take it further, nor did I ever consider that he would pose a threat to my career. The idea that I would resort to violence is simply preposterous.

On that night, I was merely attending to my duties as a member of the club. I had a few conversations with other members, discussing the latest legal trends and enjoying the ambiance. I happened to pass by the office, where Chauffeur was working late, but I assure you, I did not enter. I was preoccupied with my own thoughts and the matters at hand. It is entirely possible that he was alone, but I cannot fathom how that would implicate me in any wrongdoing. I had no motive to harm him; I was simply living my life as a dedicated lawyer.

In the aftermath of the incident, I was shocked to learn of Chauffeur's demise. I had no idea what had transpired in that office, and I certainly did not hear any commotion. I was in the lounge, surrounded by other members, engaged in conversation. It is crucial to understand that I am a respected lawyer, and my reputation is paramount. I would never jeopardize that by committing such an atrocious act. I implore you to consider the facts and the absurdity of the accusations being leveled against me.

She continued her tasks, occasionally glancing at the clock, which was nearing ten.

When the clock struck ten, Butler decided to take a quick break and headed to the bathroom. She was in there for a few minutes, washing her hands and checking her appearance in the mirror. While she was away, the murder took place in the office, leaving her completely unaware of the chaos unfolding just a few feet away.

Story to Detective: 


I was in the lounge before the incident, keeping an eye on the members and their interactions. I noticed the tension between Chauffeur and Lawyer, but I didn’t think much of it. I prefer to stay out of conflicts, especially those that don’t concern me directly. I was just doing my job, ensuring everyone was comfortable and that their needs were met. I felt uneasy about the situation, but I thought it best to remain uninvolved.

When the clock struck ten, I left the club to attend a late-night service at the church. It’s a place I go to find peace when the atmosphere at the club becomes too much. I was completely absorbed in the service, reflecting on my own thoughts and feelings, and I had no idea that anything was happening back at the club.

Means: Artist had access to the hammer, as he had been using it for a sculpture project in the club's art studio earlier that day.
Motive: None.
Opportunity: Artist was in the art studio, working on his project, when the murder occurred.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Artist was in the art studio of the exclusive club, deeply engrossed in creating a new sculpture. He had been using a hammer to shape the materials, and while he was aware of the tension between Chauffeur and Lawyer, he chose to focus on his work. The sounds of the club faded into the background as he lost himself in the creative process, occasionally glancing at the clock, which was nearing ten.

When the clock struck ten, Artist was still in the art studio, completely unaware that the murder had taken place just a few feet away in the office. He was in the zone, hammering away at his sculpture, and the noise of his work drowned out any sounds of struggle or commotion. The door to the office was closed, and he had no reason to suspect that anything was amiss.

Afterward, when Artist finally emerged from the art studio, he was met with a scene of chaos in the lounge area. Members were gathered, discussing the shocking news of Chauffeur's death. Artist felt a wave of confusion and concern wash over him, and he instinctively began to listen to the conversations around him. However, his earlier presence in the art studio made him seem suspicious, as he had been one of the last people to be seen near the murder weapon, the hammer.


Story to Detective: 


As I recount my evening, I must emphasize that my focus was solely on my art. I was in the studio, completely absorbed in my sculpture, using a hammer to shape the materials. I had noticed the tension between Chauffeur and Lawyer earlier, but I thought little of it, as I was preoccupied with my work. The clock was nearing ten, and I was determined to finish my piece, so I hardly paid attention to the world outside the studio.

When the clock struck ten, I was still hammering away, blissfully unaware of the chaos that was unfolding in the office. The door was closed, and I was so engrossed in my creative process that I didn’t hear any commotion. I had no reason to leave the studio, as I was in the midst of an artistic breakthrough. It wasn’t until I finished my work and stepped out that I was met with the shocking news of Chauffeur’s death.

I assure you, Detective, that I had no motive to harm Chauffeur. My feelings for Lawyer are complicated, but I would never resort to violence. I was merely an artist trying to create something beautiful. I understand how my presence near the hammer might raise suspicion, but I implore you to consider my innocence. I was in the art studio, lost in my work, and I had no idea that anything sinister was happening just a few feet away.

# Full Prose Prompt

I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

## Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

This is a mystery story in the style of a golden age classic. The story features the following elements:

Victim: Chauffeur (a 52-year-old man, tanned and grumpy, who speaks in a eloquent manner)
Killer: Lawyer (a 56-year-old woman, brunette and laid-back, who speaks in a eloquent manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 53-year-old man, freckled and awkward, who speaks in a verbose manner)

Other Characters:
Butler (a 27-year-old woman, average height and friendly, who speaks in a gravelly manner), Nanny (a 28-year-old man, scarred and elegant, who speaks in a terse manner), Artist (a 29-year-old man, freckled and energetic, who speaks in a eloquent manner)

It Takes Place In: Exclusive members-only club
The Crime Happened In: Office
Other Locations in the Story: Bathroom, Church

The Murder Weapon: Hammer
Other Suspicious Items: Trophy

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Hammer in the Office by Lawyer, killing Chauffeur. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: When a chauffeur is found dead in the exclusive members-only club, the eccentric Detective Detecto is drawn into a complex web of secrets and lies. As he delves deeper, he soon realizes that every character has a motive and a secret, making it harder to identify the true killer. The story is a riveting exploration of the darker side of high society, where appearances can be deceiving, and the truth is often hidden beneath layers of deception.

Lawyer's Story to the Detective: 


As I sit here recounting the events of that fateful evening, I must express my utter disbelief at the notion that I could be implicated in such a heinous act. Chauffeur and I had a professional relationship, one that was built on mutual respect, or so I thought. Yes, he had been probing into my affairs, but I dismissed it as mere curiosity. I had no reason to believe he would take it further, nor did I ever consider that he would pose a threat to my career. The idea that I would resort to violence is simply preposterous.

On that night, I was merely attending to my duties as a member of the club. I had a few conversations with other members, discussing the latest legal trends and enjoying the ambiance. I happened to pass by the office, where Chauffeur was working late, but I assure you, I did not enter. I was preoccupied with my own thoughts and the matters at hand. It is entirely possible that he was alone, but I cannot fathom how that would implicate me in any wrongdoing. I had no motive to harm him; I was simply living my life as a dedicated lawyer.

In the aftermath of the incident, I was shocked to learn of Chauffeur's demise. I had no idea what had transpired in that office, and I certainly did not hear any commotion. I was in the lounge, surrounded by other members, engaged in conversation. It is crucial to understand that I am a respected lawyer, and my reputation is paramount. I would never jeopardize that by committing such an atrocious act. I implore you to consider the facts and the absurdity of the accusations being leveled against me.

Butler's Story to the Detective: 


As I stood before Detective Detecto, I felt the weight of suspicion pressing down on me. I had been tidying up the lounge before the murder, ensuring everything was in order for the members. I noticed the tension between Chauffeur and Lawyer, but I thought it was just a typical disagreement. I had no reason to think anything sinister was afoot. When the clock struck ten, I decided to take a quick break and went to the bathroom. I was only gone for a few minutes, and I had no idea what was happening in the office during that time.

When I returned from the bathroom, I was shocked to find everyone gathered, whispering about Chauffeur's death. I felt a surge of panic. My absence could easily be misconstrued as suspicious, but I assure you, I was simply taking care of my personal needs. I had no idea that anything had happened until I walked back into the lounge. I was just as horrified as everyone else. I wanted to help, but I was caught off guard by the sudden turn of events.

I overheard some members discussing the argument between Chauffeur and Lawyer earlier, and I couldn't help but think that it might be worth mentioning. I didn't want to cast blame, but it was clear that there was tension between them. I had no motive to harm Chauffeur; I was just doing my job. I hope you can see that my actions were innocent, and I had no part in this terrible crime.


Nanny's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the lounge before the incident, keeping an eye on the members and their interactions. I noticed the tension between Chauffeur and Lawyer, but I didn’t think much of it. I prefer to stay out of conflicts, especially those that don’t concern me directly. I was just doing my job, ensuring everyone was comfortable and that their needs were met. I felt uneasy about the situation, but I thought it best to remain uninvolved.

When the clock struck ten, I left the club to attend a late-night service at the church. It’s a place I go to find peace when the atmosphere at the club becomes too much. I was completely absorbed in the service, reflecting on my own thoughts and feelings, and I had no idea that anything was happening back at the club. I was away from the scene, and I had no way of knowing what was unfolding in the office.

Upon my return, I was met with chaos. Members were gathered, discussing the shocking news of Chauffeur's death. I felt a surge of anxiety, realizing that my absence could make me look suspicious. I listened to the conversations, trying to piece together what had happened while keeping my own knowledge about the earlier argument to myself. I had no motive to harm Chauffeur, and I was simply caught in a situation that I had no control over.


Artist's Story to the Detective: 


As I recount my evening, I must emphasize that my focus was solely on my art. I was in the studio, completely absorbed in my sculpture, using a hammer to shape the materials. I had noticed the tension between Chauffeur and Lawyer earlier, but I thought little of it, as I was preoccupied with my work. The clock was nearing ten, and I was determined to finish my piece, so I hardly paid attention to the world outside the studio.

When the clock struck ten, I was still hammering away, blissfully unaware of the chaos that was unfolding in the office. The door was closed, and I was so engrossed in my creative process that I didn’t hear any commotion. I had no reason to leave the studio, as I was in the midst of an artistic breakthrough. It wasn’t until I finished my work and stepped out that I was met with the shocking news of Chauffeur’s death.

I assure you, Detective, that I had no motive to harm Chauffeur. My feelings for Lawyer are complicated, but I would never resort to violence. I was merely an artist trying to create something beautiful. I understand how my presence near the hammer might raise suspicion, but I implore you to consider my innocence. I was in the art studio, lost in my work, and I had no idea that anything sinister was happening just a few feet away.

## Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.
You should use dialog to convey information engage the reader.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point, narrated by Detecto and using dialog where appropriate.

# Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the exclusive members-only club, his freckled face a mask of concentration as he surveyed the scene of the crime. The victim, the club's chauffeur, lay lifeless on the office floor, a hammer resting ominously nearby, its handle stained with blood. 

Detecto noted the presence of four individuals: the Lawyer, the Artist, the Butler, and the Nanny, each a potential suspect in this grim tableau. "No one else could have been here," he mused aloud, his voice carrying a verbose authority that demanded attention.

He began his investigation by speaking with the Artist, who claimed, "I was in the art studio, completely absorbed in my sculpture when the murder occurred." Detecto's eyes lingered on the hammer, recalling the Artist's access to such tools for his work, a detail the Artist had not volunteered.

Turning to the Butler, Detecto inquired about her whereabouts during the murder. "I was in the bathroom," she replied, her gravelly voice tinged with defensiveness, aware that her absence might appear suspicious.

The Lawyer, maintaining an air of nonchalance, protested her innocence, "I assure you, Detective, I had no reason to harm the Chauffeur." Yet, Detecto's keen mind pieced together the motive: the Chauffeur had uncovered sensitive information about the Lawyer's dealings, a threat to her career she could not afford.

Detecto's attention shifted to the Nanny, who remarked, "I noticed the tension between Chauffeur and Lawyer earlier." The Nanny's terse manner belied the unease Detecto sensed, as he deduced the Nanny's absence at a church service during the murder.

The Artist, eager to clear his name, insisted, "Other club members saw me in the studio; I wasn't near the office." Detecto noted the Artist's proximity to the murder weapon, a fact that could not be ignored.

The Lawyer, in an attempt to divert attention, commented on the club's peculiarities, "The painting of a cat with a monocle always makes me chuckle," she said, her laughter hollow in the somber setting.

Detecto listened as the Butler recounted her return from the bathroom, "I was shocked to find everyone gathered, whispering about Chauffeur's death." Her story seemed plausible, yet Detecto remained vigilant for inconsistencies.

The Nanny, his anxiety palpable, chose to remain silent about the earlier argument between Chauffeur and Lawyer, a decision that piqued Detecto's curiosity. "I felt a wave of anxiety," the Nanny admitted, aware that his absence might cast suspicion upon him.

As Detecto pieced together the evening's events, he observed the Artist's protestations of innocence, "I was in the studio, lost in my work." Yet, the hammer's presence loomed large in Detecto's mind, a silent witness to the crime.

The Lawyer, attempting to establish an alibi, mentioned, "At ten o'clock, I found Chauffeur engrossed in his work in the office." Detecto noted the timing, aligning it with the moment of the murder.

The Butler, eager to assert her innocence, described a scene of levity, "I saw a member trying to balance coasters on their head as a joke." Her attempt at humor did little to dispel the gravity of the situation.

Detecto, his mind a whirlwind of deductions, knew that the truth lay hidden among these tangled stories. "It must be one of these suspects," he thought, his freckled brow furrowed in contemplation, "and I know just who it is."
