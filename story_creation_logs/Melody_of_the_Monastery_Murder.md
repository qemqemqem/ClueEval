# Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a dagger, a sharp and lethal weapon that Nurse had access to in the monastery's kitchen, where various tools were kept for food preparation.
Motive: Nurse felt deeply undervalued and disrespected by Musician, who often belittled his work and made snide remarks about his stuttering. This constant humiliation fostered a growing resentment, leading Nurse to fantasize about a world where Musician no longer existed.
Opportunity: Musician was vulnerable during the late evening hours when he was alone in his apartment, having just finished a rehearsal. The monastery was quiet, and the other residents were occupied with their own activities, providing Nurse with the perfect chance to act without being seen.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Nurse was in the kitchen, preparing a late-night snack. He had been listening to Musician's loud and obnoxious playing from the apartment next door, which only intensified his simmering anger. As he chopped vegetables, he imagined confronting Musician, but instead, he focused on the rhythmic sound of the knife against the cutting board, which oddly soothed him. He knew that Musician would be alone soon, as the other residents were busy with their evening routines.

When the time was right, Nurse quietly left the kitchen and made his way to Musician's apartment. He knocked softly, feigning a casual demeanor, and when Musician opened the door, he was greeted with a condescending remark about Nurse's stutter. This was the final straw. In a moment of rage, Nurse pushed his way inside, brandishing the dagger he had concealed in his pocket. The confrontation escalated quickly, and in a flurry of movement, Nurse struck Musician, who fell to the floor, lifeless.

After the deed was done, Nurse panicked. He quickly cleaned the dagger and returned it to the kitchen, hiding it among the other utensils. He then composed himself and returned to his own quarters, trying to act as if nothing had happened. He spent the rest of the night pacing, rehearsing his alibi in his mind, and convincing himself that he had done nothing wrong, all while the echoes of the murder haunted him.


Story to Detective: 


I-I-I was in the kitchen, you see, preparing a snack. I-I-I often do that late at night. I-I-I heard Musician playing, and it was, um, quite loud, as usual. He always had this way of, um, making me feel small, you know? I-I-I was chopping vegetables, and I-I-I couldn’t help but think about how he always looked down on me. It was just a snack, really, nothing special, but I-I-I couldn’t shake the feeling of anger building inside me. 

When I finished, I-I-I decided to check on him. I-I-I knocked on his door, and when he opened it, he made one of those snide comments about my stutter. It was like a switch flipped in my mind. I-I-I just wanted to talk, but it turned into something else. I-I-I don’t know how it happened, but I-I-I was inside his apartment, and then it all went dark. I-I-I didn’t mean for it to go that far, but he was so condescending, and I-I-I just lost control for a moment. 

Afterward, I-I-I was terrified. I-I-I cleaned everything up, put the dagger back where it belonged, and returned to my room. I-I-I thought about what to say, how to explain myself. I-I-I didn’t do anything wrong, not really. I-I-I just wanted to be treated with respect, and now, well, now it’s all a mess. I-I-I swear, I-I-I didn’t mean for it to happen like this.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Guard was busy in the monastery’s common area, energetically tidying up and preparing for the next day. She was known for her dramatic flair, often recounting tales of bravery and heroism to the other residents. As the evening wore on, she felt a sense of unease creeping in, especially with the loud music coming from Musician's apartment. To distract herself, she decided to check on the supplies in the cellar, a task she often undertook to keep her mind occupied.

While in the cellar, Guard was rummaging through boxes and organizing items, completely unaware of the events unfolding in Musician's apartment. The sounds of the music faded into the background as she focused on her task, but she did hear a sudden commotion that made her pause. However, her fear of the dark and the eerie silence that followed compelled her to stay put, convincing herself that it was just her imagination playing tricks on her.

After the murder, Guard returned to the common area, where she found other residents gathered, whispering in hushed tones about the tragedy. She was shocked to learn of Musician's death and immediately began to express her concern for the safety of everyone in the monastery. Her energetic demeanor, however, made her seem overly dramatic, and she began checking on each resident, which only added to the suspicion surrounding her actions.


Story to Detective: 


I was simply trying to keep myself busy before the murder occurred. I had been tidying up the common area, as I always do, and I couldn’t help but feel anxious with all the noise coming from Musician’s apartment. I decided to head down to the cellar to organize supplies, as it helps me focus and keeps my mind off things. I was in the cellar when I heard a sudden noise, but I convinced myself it was nothing. I was just trying to avoid the dark, you see; it makes me uneasy.

When I returned to the common area, I was shocked to find everyone gathered and whispering about Musician’s death. I had no idea what had happened until I heard the news. My heart sank, and I felt a rush of concern for everyone’s safety. I began checking on the other residents, wanting to ensure they were all right. I know it may have seemed suspicious, but I was only acting out of fear and concern. I never wished harm upon Musician; I just wanted to keep the peace in our home.

I can’t help but feel that Nurse is acting strangely. He always seemed a bit off, and I overheard him mumbling about Musician’s music earlier that evening. I wouldn’t be surprised if he had something to do with it. I know I may seem suspicious with my energetic behavior, but I assure you, I had no motive or means to harm anyone. I was just trying to keep myself occupied and ensure everyone was safe.


# Parsed Story for Firefighter

Means: None
Motive: None
Opportunity: Firefighter was in the common area, distracted by the loud music from Musician's apartment, making him unaware of the murder.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Firefighter was in the common area of the monastery, trying to entertain himself while the loud music from Musician's apartment blared in the background. He was joking around with some of the other residents, making sarcastic comments about the noise and how it was a fire hazard. He had a playful demeanor, but he was also a bit annoyed by the disruption, wishing for some peace and quiet to focus on his own interests.

When the murder occurred, Firefighter was still in the common area, engaged in a game of cards with a few other residents. The loud music made it difficult to hear anything else, and he was completely oblivious to the commotion happening next door. He was laughing and joking, trying to lighten the mood, and his attention was solely on the game, which kept him from noticing the critical events unfolding in Musician's apartment.

After the murder, Firefighter was one of the first to hear the commotion when the other residents began to gather and whisper about the tragedy. He quickly joined the group, feigning shock and concern, but his sarcastic comments about the situation made him seem callous. He tried to help by suggesting they check on the other residents, but his lighthearted attitude only raised eyebrows, making him appear suspicious in the eyes of others.


Story to Detective: 


I was just hanging out in the common area before the murder, trying to have a good time with the other residents. The music from Musician's apartment was so loud that it was hard to focus on anything else. I mean, who could concentrate with that racket? I was playing cards and cracking jokes, trying to lighten the mood. I didn't even notice anything strange happening until everyone started gathering and whispering about the murder. 

When I heard the news, I was genuinely shocked. I mean, who wouldn't be? I jumped right in with the others, trying to figure out what happened. I suggested we check on everyone else, but I guess my sarcastic comments made me look bad. I didn't mean to come off as insensitive; I just thought it would help to keep things light. I was completely unaware of what was going on next door, and I swear I had no reason to want Musician dead. 

Honestly, if anyone should be looked at suspiciously, it’s that Nurse. I mean, he always seemed a bit off, and I heard he had a problem with Musician's music too. But hey, I’m just a kid trying to enjoy my time here, not some murderer. I was busy playing cards, and I didn't have any means to commit a crime. I just want to clear my name and get back to my life.

Panicking, she quickly gathered the remnants and hid them behind a nearby cabinet, hoping no one would notice.

When the murder occurred, Butcher was still in the common area, engaged in her own world and oblivious to the loud music coming from Musician's apartment. She was focused on her task and did not hear the commotion next door.

After the murder, Butcher was startled when the other residents began to gather and whisper about the tragedy. She felt a wave of anxiety wash over her, fearing that her earlier mishap with the vase would come to light. As the others expressed their shock, she tried to blend in, but her nervousness made her fidgety and distracted.

I was just trying to keep things tidy, and I didn’t mean for it to happen.

When the noise started next door, I was so wrapped up in my own little world that I didn’t even hear it. I was glancing at the card game, but my mind was elsewhere, thinking about what I would cook for dinner. I didn’t realize anything was wrong until everyone started gathering and whispering about the tragedy. I felt so out of place, and I was worried that someone would find out about the vase. I didn’t want to seem suspicious, but I couldn’t help fidgeting.

After the news broke, I tried to check on the supplies again, just to keep myself busy and not draw attention to my nervousness. I didn’t want anyone to think I was involved in anything. I swear, I was just trying to keep things in order! I didn’t hear anything, and I had no reason to want Musician dead. I’m just a simple butcher, and I wouldn’t hurt a fly, let alone someone like him.

# Full Prose Prompt

I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

## Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

This is a mystery story in the style of a golden age classic. The story features the following elements:

Victim: Musician (a 45-year-old man, lanky and mean, who speaks in a formal manner)
Killer: Nurse (a 35-year-old man, grey-haired and stuttering, who speaks in a mumbling manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 39-year-old man, grey-haired and suspicious, who speaks in a eloquent manner)

Other Characters:
Guard (a 61-year-old woman, blonde and energetic, who speaks in a dramatic manner), Firefighter (a 18-year-old man, tanned and outgoing, who speaks in a sarcastic manner), Butcher (a 38-year-old woman, short and absent-minded, who speaks in a sing-song manner)

It Takes Place In: Monastery
The Crime Happened In: Apartment
Other Locations in the Story: Office, Cellar

The Murder Weapon: Dagger
Other Suspicious Items: Rope

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Dagger in the Apartment by Nurse, killing Musician. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In the cloistered halls of a quiet monastery, a brutal murder shatters the peace. Renowned Detective Detecto is called upon to unravel the deadly enigma, navigating a labyrinth of deception, betrayal, and hidden secrets, where not even the holy are above suspicion.

Nurse's Story to the Detective: 


I-I-I was in the kitchen, you see, preparing a snack. I-I-I often do that late at night. I-I-I heard Musician playing, and it was, um, quite loud, as usual. He always had this way of, um, making me feel small, you know? I-I-I was chopping vegetables, and I-I-I couldn’t help but think about how he always looked down on me. It was just a snack, really, nothing special, but I-I-I couldn’t shake the feeling of anger building inside me. 

When I finished, I-I-I decided to check on him. I-I-I knocked on his door, and when he opened it, he made one of those snide comments about my stutter. It was like a switch flipped in my mind. I-I-I just wanted to talk, but it turned into something else. I-I-I don’t know how it happened, but I-I-I was inside his apartment, and then it all went dark. I-I-I didn’t mean for it to go that far, but he was so condescending, and I-I-I just lost control for a moment. 

Afterward, I-I-I was terrified. I-I-I cleaned everything up, put the dagger back where it belonged, and returned to my room. I-I-I thought about what to say, how to explain myself. I-I-I didn’t do anything wrong, not really. I-I-I just wanted to be treated with respect, and now, well, now it’s all a mess. I-I-I swear, I-I-I didn’t mean for it to happen like this.

Guard's Story to the Detective: 


I was simply trying to keep myself busy before the murder occurred. I had been tidying up the common area, as I always do, and I couldn’t help but feel anxious with all the noise coming from Musician’s apartment. I decided to head down to the cellar to organize supplies, as it helps me focus and keeps my mind off things. I was in the cellar when I heard a sudden noise, but I convinced myself it was nothing. I was just trying to avoid the dark, you see; it makes me uneasy.

When I returned to the common area, I was shocked to find everyone gathered and whispering about Musician’s death. I had no idea what had happened until I heard the news. My heart sank, and I felt a rush of concern for everyone’s safety. I began checking on the other residents, wanting to ensure they were all right. I know it may have seemed suspicious, but I was only acting out of fear and concern. I never wished harm upon Musician; I just wanted to keep the peace in our home.

I can’t help but feel that Nurse is acting strangely. He always seemed a bit off, and I overheard him mumbling about Musician’s music earlier that evening. I wouldn’t be surprised if he had something to do with it. I know I may seem suspicious with my energetic behavior, but I assure you, I had no motive or means to harm anyone. I was just trying to keep myself occupied and ensure everyone was safe.


Firefighter's Story to the Detective: 


I was just hanging out in the common area before the murder, trying to have a good time with the other residents. The music from Musician's apartment was so loud that it was hard to focus on anything else. I mean, who could concentrate with that racket? I was playing cards and cracking jokes, trying to lighten the mood. I didn't even notice anything strange happening until everyone started gathering and whispering about the murder. 

When I heard the news, I was genuinely shocked. I mean, who wouldn't be? I jumped right in with the others, trying to figure out what happened. I suggested we check on everyone else, but I guess my sarcastic comments made me look bad. I didn't mean to come off as insensitive; I just thought it would help to keep things light. I was completely unaware of what was going on next door, and I swear I had no reason to want Musician dead. 

Honestly, if anyone should be looked at suspiciously, it’s that Nurse. I mean, he always seemed a bit off, and I heard he had a problem with Musician's music too. But hey, I’m just a kid trying to enjoy my time here, not some murderer. I was busy playing cards, and I didn't have any means to commit a crime. I just want to clear my name and get back to my life.


Butcher's Story to the Detective: 


I was just minding my own business, you see, in the common area, preparing for the next day’s meals. I was humming a little tune, lost in my thoughts, when I accidentally knocked over that vase. Oh dear, it shattered into pieces, and I panicked! I quickly hid the bits behind the cabinet, hoping no one would notice. I didn’t want to get in trouble, you know? I was just trying to keep things tidy, and I didn’t mean for it to happen.

When the noise started next door, I was so wrapped up in my own little world that I didn’t even hear it. I was glancing at the card game, but my mind was elsewhere, thinking about what I would cook for dinner. I didn’t realize anything was wrong until everyone started gathering and whispering about the tragedy. I felt so out of place, and I was worried that someone would find out about the vase. I didn’t want to seem suspicious, but I couldn’t help fidgeting.

After the news broke, I tried to check on the supplies again, just to keep myself busy and not draw attention to my nervousness. I didn’t want anyone to think I was involved in anything. I swear, I was just trying to keep things in order! I didn’t hear anything, and I had no reason to want Musician dead. I’m just a simple butcher, and I wouldn’t hurt a fly, let alone someone like him.

## Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.
You should use dialog to convey information engage the reader.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point, narrated by Detecto and using dialog where appropriate.

# Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the monastery, his keen eyes immediately drawn to the lifeless form of the Musician sprawled on the apartment floor, a dagger protruding from his chest, the crimson stain spreading ominously across the carpet. The air was thick with tension as he surveyed the scene, noting the four individuals present: the Guard, the Butcher, the Firefighter, and the Nurse—each a potential suspect in this grim tableau. 

Detecto began his inquiry with the Butcher, who stood wringing her hands, her voice a melodic protest, "I swear, Detective, I was in the common area, lost in my thoughts and the card game, completely unaware of anything happening next door." Her eyes darted nervously, betraying her concealed anxiety about the vase she had accidentally shattered, a detail she hoped would remain hidden. 

Turning to the Firefighter, Detecto observed the young man's casual demeanor as he declared, "I was just trying to enjoy myself in the common area, but that music was so loud, I couldn't hear a thing." The Firefighter's attempt to lighten the mood with a story about burning pasta and a joke about a horror-movie-worthy plant seemed to mask a deeper unease. 

The Guard, with her dramatic flair, recounted, "I was in the cellar, organizing supplies, when I found an old board game that brought back fond memories." Her claim of innocence was bolstered by the fact that the cellar had been locked from the inside, a detail Detecto noted with interest. 

Detecto's attention then shifted to the Nurse, whose mumbling protest, "I-I-I was just in the kitchen, preparing a snack," seemed to conceal a deeper resentment. The detective's sharp intuition picked up on the Nurse's underlying bitterness towards the Musician, a sentiment that had festered over time. 

The Butcher's alibi was corroborated by witnesses who confirmed her presence in the common area, never venturing near the Musician's apartment. Meanwhile, the Guard's insistence on her innocence was supported by the locked cellar door, which could not have been breached without her knowledge. 

The Nurse's story faltered as he stammered, "It all went dark after I lost control," a slip that Detecto noted with a discerning eye. The Firefighter's sarcastic remarks and eagerness to deflect suspicion onto the Nurse only served to heighten the detective's scrutiny. 

Detecto observed the Firefighter's lack of access to the dagger, a crucial piece of evidence that seemed to exonerate him. The Guard's actions, though suspicious, were consistent with her role in ensuring the safety of the residents. 

As the Nurse paced, rehearsing his alibi, Detecto pieced together the subtle clues, his mind a whirl of deductions and possibilities. It was clear that one of these individuals was responsible for the heinous act, and with a knowing glance, Detecto prepared to reveal the truth.
