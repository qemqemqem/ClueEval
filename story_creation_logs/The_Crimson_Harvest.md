# Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using an axe, which was typically stored in the shed for chopping wood. Nanny had easy access to it, as he often helped with chores around the estate.
Motive: Nanny felt undervalued and disrespected by Farmer, who often belittled him and dismissed his contributions to the household. The constant sarcasm and harsh treatment led Nanny to harbor resentment, believing that Farmer's attitude stifled his potential and happiness.
Opportunity: Farmer was vulnerable to attack when she was alone in her apartment, taking a break from her daily tasks. This was a time when Nanny knew she would be distracted and less likely to call for help.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Nanny was in the kitchen preparing lunch while Farmer was outside tending to her crops. The atmosphere was tense, as Farmer's grumpy demeanor had been particularly biting that morning. Nanny, feeling the weight of Farmer's sarcasm, decided to take a break and stepped outside to gather his thoughts. He noticed Farmer's frustration as she struggled with a stubborn piece of equipment, and he felt a surge of anger at her dismissive attitude towards him.

The murder occurred in the apartment when Farmer returned inside to rest. Nanny had already positioned himself in the shadows, waiting for the right moment. As Farmer entered, he seized the opportunity, using the axe to strike swiftly and decisively. The act was quick, fueled by a mix of pent-up frustration and a desire to escape the oppressive atmosphere that Farmer had created in their lives.

After the murder, Nanny quickly cleaned up the scene, hiding the axe back in the shed and ensuring that no signs of struggle were left behind. He then composed himself and returned to the kitchen, acting as if nothing had happened. When the other characters began to gather, he maintained his calm demeanor, deflecting any suspicion and blending into the background, all while feeling a mix of relief and dread about what he had just done.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the kitchen preparing lunch when Farmer was outside. I had my hands full, chopping vegetables and trying to ignore the tension in the air. Farmer was always so grumpy, and her sarcasm was unbearable. I stepped outside for a moment to clear my head, but I could see her struggling with that old piece of equipment. It was frustrating to watch, but I didn’t want to get involved. I knew she wouldn’t appreciate my help anyway.

When she finally came back inside, I was already in the apartment, just tidying up. I thought about how she always dismissed my efforts, how she never recognized my contributions. It was in that moment, with her back turned and her guard down, that I acted. I didn’t plan it; it just happened. I grabbed the axe from where it was hidden and struck. It was over before I realized what I had done. I felt a rush of emotions, but I didn’t have time to dwell on them.

Afterward, I cleaned up quickly. I put the axe back where it belonged, in the shed, and made sure everything looked normal. I returned to the kitchen, trying to act casual as the others began to gather. I didn’t want anyone to suspect anything. I was just doing my job, like always. I didn’t do anything wrong; I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

# Parsed Story for Maid

Means: Maid had access to cleaning supplies, but no weapon that could be used for murder.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Maid was in the drawing room, dusting and organizing when the murder occurred, making her unaware of the events in the apartment.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Maid was busy in the drawing room, dusting the furniture and arranging the books on the shelves. She was humming to herself, trying to keep her spirits up despite the grumpy atmosphere created by Farmer. While cleaning, she accidentally knocked over a valuable vase, which shattered on the floor. Fearing the consequences of her clumsiness, she hurriedly cleaned up the mess, trying to hide the incident from the others.

When the murder took place, Maid was still in the drawing room, completely unaware of the events unfolding in the apartment. She was focused on her task, occasionally glancing out the window at the garden, where she could see Farmer working outside. The sounds of the axe striking and Farmer's sudden silence went unnoticed by Maid, as she was engrossed in her cleaning duties and the faint sounds of nature surrounding her.

After the murder, Maid continued her work in the drawing room, trying to maintain her usual energetic demeanor. When the other characters began to gather, she noticed their tense expressions and felt a sense of unease. Maid decided to join them, hoping to blend in and avoid drawing attention to herself. However, her earlier accident with the vase weighed heavily on her mind, making her actions appear suspicious as she fidgeted and avoided eye contact with the others.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the drawing room, dusting and organizing the books when the incident occurred. I had my hands full with cleaning supplies, and I was focused on making everything presentable. I accidentally broke a vase while I was dusting, and I was worried about what Farmer would say if she found out. I was just trying to clean up the mess and keep things in order, so I didn’t hear anything unusual from the apartment. I was too preoccupied with my own tasks to notice anything amiss.

When I finished in the drawing room, I noticed the others gathering, and I felt a sense of dread. I thought maybe they were discussing the vase I broke, and I was worried they would blame me for it. I tried to act normal, but I could see the tension in the air. I didn’t want to draw attention to myself, so I kept my head down and focused on my work. I had no idea what had happened until they started talking about Farmer being hurt.

I assure you, I had no motive to harm Farmer. I was just trying to do my job and keep the estate running smoothly. I didn’t have any weapons or means to commit such a crime. I was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, and now I fear my clumsiness with the vase has made me look suspicious. I hope you can see that I had nothing to do with this terrible event.


# Parsed Story for Waiter

Means: None.
Motive: None.
Opportunity: Waiter was in the kitchen preparing lunch when the murder occurred.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Waiter was bustling about the kitchen, preparing a hearty lunch for the household. She was focused on her tasks, chopping vegetables and stirring pots, occasionally humming to herself. While she was busy, she overheard a muffled argument coming from the drawing room, but she didn't pay much attention to it, assuming it was just the usual bickering between Farmer and Nanny. Her absent-mindedness made her unaware of the tension building between them.

When the murder took place, Waiter was still in the kitchen, completely engrossed in her cooking. She was unaware of the events unfolding in the apartment, as the sounds of her work drowned out any noise from the other rooms. The kitchen was bustling with the aroma of spices and simmering broth, and she was excitedly planning the meal, oblivious to the danger lurking just a few feet away.

After the murder, Waiter continued her work, but she noticed the sudden change in atmosphere when the other characters began to gather. Their tense expressions and hushed voices made her uneasy. She tried to engage them in conversation about lunch, but her enthusiasm seemed out of place. As the others exchanged worried glances, Waiter felt a growing sense of suspicion directed toward her, even though she had no involvement in the crime.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the kitchen preparing lunch when the murder happened. I was so focused on my tasks, chopping vegetables and stirring the pot, that I didn’t hear anything unusual. I did overhear some arguing earlier, but I thought it was just the usual back-and-forth between Farmer and Nanny. I didn’t think much of it at the time, and I certainly didn’t expect anything like this to happen. I was just trying to make a nice meal for everyone.

When I noticed the others gathering, I could feel the tension in the air. They all looked so serious, and I thought maybe they were just hungry or something. I tried to lighten the mood by talking about lunch, but it felt like my enthusiasm was misplaced. I didn’t understand why everyone was acting so strange. I just wanted to serve a good meal and keep things cheerful, but it seemed like my presence was making things worse.

I know it looks suspicious, but I promise I had nothing to do with it. I was in the kitchen the whole time, and I didn’t even have a weapon. I think you should look at Nanny more closely. He seemed a bit off today, and I overheard him arguing with Farmer earlier. Maybe he was more affected by her sarcasm than I realized. I just want to help clear this up and get back to making lunch.


# Parsed Story for Bartender

Means: Bartender had access to the axe, as it was stored in the shed where he occasionally retrieved tools for the estate's maintenance.
Motive: None
Opportunity: Bartender was in the drawing room, preparing for a small gathering when Farmer was vulnerable in the apartment.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Bartender was busy in the drawing room, setting up for a small gathering that was planned for later in the day. He was arranging drinks and snacks, trying to create a pleasant atmosphere despite the tension he sensed among the household. As he worked, he occasionally glanced out the window, catching sight of Farmer laboring in the garden. He felt a mix of admiration and frustration, knowing that Farmer's grumpy demeanor often overshadowed her hard work and dedication.

When the murder occurred, Bartender was still in the drawing room, completely unaware of the events unfolding in the apartment. He was focused on his tasks, adjusting the placement of glasses and ensuring everything was in order. The sounds of the axe striking and Farmer's sudden silence went unnoticed by him, as he was preoccupied with his preparations and the distant sounds of nature. The atmosphere in the estate felt heavy, but he attributed it to the usual bickering between Farmer and Nanny.

After the murder, Bartender continued his work in the drawing room, but he quickly sensed a shift in the mood as the other characters began to gather. Their tense expressions and hushed voices made him uneasy. He tried to engage them in conversation about the gathering, but his enthusiasm felt out of place amidst the growing tension. As the others exchanged worried glances, Bartender felt a pang of anxiety, fearing that his innocent actions might be misinterpreted in the wake of the tragedy.


Story to Detective:

I noticed Farmer working outside, but I was focused on my tasks and didn’t hear anything unusual. The sounds of the axe striking and Farmer's sudden silence were completely lost on me as I was engrossed in my work. I thought the tension in the house was just the usual bickering between Farmer and Nanny.

When I heard the others gathering, I felt a shift in the atmosphere. Their expressions were tense, and I could sense something was wrong. I tried to engage them in conversation about the gathering, but it felt like my enthusiasm was misplaced. I was genuinely excited about the event, but the mood was so heavy that it made me feel uneasy. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible had happened, but I had no idea what it was.

I want to make it clear that I had no motive to harm Farmer. I admired her hard work, even if her grumpy nature often overshadowed it. I had access to the axe, but I never intended to use it for anything other than its intended purpose. I was simply trying to create a nice atmosphere for everyone, and I would never dream of hurting Farmer. If anyone should be looked at with suspicion, it’s Nanny. He always seemed to be on edge around Farmer, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he snapped.

# Full Prose Prompt

I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

## Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

This is a mystery story in the style of a golden age classic. The story features the following elements:

Victim: Farmer (a 54-year-old woman, redhead and grumpy, who speaks in a sarcastic manner)
Killer: Nanny (a 26-year-old man, brunette and elegant, who speaks in a terse manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 46-year-old woman, tanned and confident, who speaks in a enthusiastic manner)

Other Characters:
Maid (a 68-year-old woman, redhead and energetic, who speaks in a monotone manner), Waiter (a 43-year-old woman, thin and absent-minded, who speaks in a enthusiastic manner), Bartender (a 24-year-old man, tanned and energetic, who speaks in a articulate manner)

It Takes Place In: Secluded country estate
The Crime Happened In: Apartment
Other Locations in the Story: Patio, Drawing Room

The Murder Weapon: Axe
Other Suspicious Items: Grenade

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Axe in the Apartment by Nanny, killing Farmer. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In the serene backdrop of a secluded country estate, a grumpy farmer meets her untimely demise, victim to an axe-wielding Nanny. Amidst a web of deceit, eccentric characters, and a looming grenade threat, the confident Detective Detecto must untangle the mystery before the perpetrator strikes again.

Nanny's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the kitchen preparing lunch when Farmer was outside. I had my hands full, chopping vegetables and trying to ignore the tension in the air. Farmer was always so grumpy, and her sarcasm was unbearable. I stepped outside for a moment to clear my head, but I could see her struggling with that old piece of equipment. It was frustrating to watch, but I didn’t want to get involved. I knew she wouldn’t appreciate my help anyway.

When she finally came back inside, I was already in the apartment, just tidying up. I thought about how she always dismissed my efforts, how she never recognized my contributions. It was in that moment, with her back turned and her guard down, that I acted. I didn’t plan it; it just happened. I grabbed the axe from where it was hidden and struck. It was over before I realized what I had done. I felt a rush of emotions, but I didn’t have time to dwell on them.

Afterward, I cleaned up quickly. I put the axe back where it belonged, in the shed, and made sure everything looked normal. I returned to the kitchen, trying to act casual as the others began to gather. I didn’t want anyone to suspect anything. I was just doing my job, like always. I didn’t do anything wrong; I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Maid's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the drawing room, dusting and organizing the books when the incident occurred. I had my hands full with cleaning supplies, and I was focused on making everything presentable. I accidentally broke a vase while I was dusting, and I was worried about what Farmer would say if she found out. I was just trying to clean up the mess and keep things in order, so I didn’t hear anything unusual from the apartment. I was too preoccupied with my own tasks to notice anything amiss.

When I finished in the drawing room, I noticed the others gathering, and I felt a sense of dread. I thought maybe they were discussing the vase I broke, and I was worried they would blame me for it. I tried to act normal, but I could see the tension in the air. I didn’t want to draw attention to myself, so I kept my head down and focused on my work. I had no idea what had happened until they started talking about Farmer being hurt.

I assure you, I had no motive to harm Farmer. I was just trying to do my job and keep the estate running smoothly. I didn’t have any weapons or means to commit such a crime. I was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, and now I fear my clumsiness with the vase has made me look suspicious. I hope you can see that I had nothing to do with this terrible event.


Waiter's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the kitchen preparing lunch when the murder happened. I was so focused on my tasks, chopping vegetables and stirring the pot, that I didn’t hear anything unusual. I did overhear some arguing earlier, but I thought it was just the usual back-and-forth between Farmer and Nanny. I didn’t think much of it at the time, and I certainly didn’t expect anything like this to happen. I was just trying to make a nice meal for everyone.

When I noticed the others gathering, I could feel the tension in the air. They all looked so serious, and I thought maybe they were just hungry or something. I tried to lighten the mood by talking about lunch, but it felt like my enthusiasm was misplaced. I didn’t understand why everyone was acting so strange. I just wanted to serve a good meal and keep things cheerful, but it seemed like my presence was making things worse.

I know it looks suspicious, but I promise I had nothing to do with it. I was in the kitchen the whole time, and I didn’t even have a weapon. I think you should look at Nanny more closely. He seemed a bit off today, and I overheard him arguing with Farmer earlier. Maybe he was more affected by her sarcasm than I realized. I just want to help clear this up and get back to making lunch.


Bartender's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the drawing room preparing for a small gathering when the murder took place. I was busy arranging drinks and snacks, trying to create a pleasant atmosphere for everyone. I noticed Farmer working outside, but I was focused on my tasks and didn’t hear anything unusual. The sounds of the axe striking and Farmer's sudden silence were completely lost on me as I was engrossed in my work. I thought the tension in the house was just the usual bickering between Farmer and Nanny.

When I heard the others gathering, I felt a shift in the atmosphere. Their expressions were tense, and I could sense something was wrong. I tried to engage them in conversation about the gathering, but it felt like my enthusiasm was misplaced. I was genuinely excited about the event, but the mood was so heavy that it made me feel uneasy. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible had happened, but I had no idea what it was.

I want to make it clear that I had no motive to harm Farmer. I admired her hard work, even if her grumpy nature often overshadowed it. I had access to the axe, but I never intended to use it for anything other than its intended purpose. I was simply trying to create a nice atmosphere for everyone, and I would never dream of hurting Farmer. If anyone should be looked at with suspicion, it’s Nanny. He always seemed to be on edge around Farmer, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he snapped.

## Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.
You should use dialog to convey information engage the reader.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point, narrated by Detecto and using dialog where appropriate.

# Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the secluded country estate, her enthusiasm undeterred by the grim scene awaiting her in the apartment. The victim, Farmer, lay lifeless on the floor, the brutal evidence of an axe attack unmistakable in the crimson stains that marred the room. As she surveyed the scene, Detecto noted the presence of four individuals: Waiter, Bartender, Maid, and Nanny, the only possible witnesses or suspects in this isolated setting.

Detecto began her inquiry with Bartender, who insisted, "I was in the drawing room, preparing for a small gathering when Farmer was attacked." Despite his protests of innocence, Detecto's keen eye caught the faint scent of fresh wood on his hands, suggesting recent contact with the axe stored in the shed. "While arranging the snacks," Bartender continued, "I remembered last year's gathering when the cake fell over, and I was experimenting with new cocktail recipes." His mention of wilting flowers in the drawing room seemed an attempt to divert attention, but Detecto remained focused.

Turning to Maid, Detecto listened as she recounted, "I accidentally knocked over a valuable vase and was busy cleaning up the mess." Her story of humming a catchy jingle while tidying up seemed plausible, yet Detecto noticed the absence of any weapon among her cleaning supplies. "I often talk to the plants in the garden," Maid added, her monotone voice betraying no hint of deceit. The broken vase and scattered cleaning tools confirmed her preoccupation with her duties, leaving her with little opportunity for murder.

Nanny, with a terse demeanor, claimed, "I was in the kitchen, trying to act casual as the others gathered." Detecto sensed an underlying tension in his words, a hint of resentment towards Farmer's dismissive attitude. The detective's intuition told her that Nanny's familiarity with the axe, often used for estate chores, was more than coincidental. His protest of innocence was unconvincing, as Detecto noted the subtle shift in his gaze when discussing Farmer's vulnerability.

Finally, Waiter, with an air of absent-mindedness, stated, "I was in the kitchen preparing lunch when the murder occurred." Her enthusiasm seemed genuine, and Detecto found no motive in her interactions with Farmer. "I think you should look at Nanny more closely," Waiter suggested, her words echoing Detecto's growing suspicion. The detective's investigation revealed Waiter's positive relationship with Farmer, further distancing her from the crime.

As Detecto pieced together the puzzle, she observed the dynamics among the suspects, each with their own secrets and alibis. The evidence pointed in a clear direction, and Detecto knew exactly who had wielded the axe in the apartment.
