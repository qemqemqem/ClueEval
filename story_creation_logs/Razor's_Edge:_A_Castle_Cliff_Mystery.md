# Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a razor, a tool that Maid had access to in the castle's kitchen. It was sharp and easily concealed, making it a suitable weapon for a sudden attack.
Motive: Maid felt overshadowed by Sailor's brash personality and blunt manner. Sailor often belittled Maid's contributions around the castle, making him feel inadequate and resentful. The constant humiliation and Sailor's dismissive attitude fueled a desire for revenge.
Opportunity: Sailor was vulnerable when she retreated to the Cabin after a heated argument with Maid. The storm outside created a cacophony of noise, masking any sounds of struggle, and the isolation of the Cabin made it easy for Maid to approach without being seen.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Maid was in the kitchen, preparing a meal for the household. Sailor had just finished a round of mocking comments about Maid's cooking skills, which left Maid feeling humiliated and angry. As the storm raged outside, Maid's emotions boiled over, and he decided to confront Sailor. He waited until Sailor stormed off to the Cabin, believing she needed time alone to cool down.

In the Cabin, Sailor was pacing back and forth, muttering to herself about the unfairness of her situation. Maid approached quietly, the sound of the rain and thunder drowning out his footsteps. He slipped inside the Cabin, where Sailor was momentarily distracted by the storm. In a swift motion, Maid drew the razor from his pocket and attacked, catching Sailor off guard. The struggle was brief, and Sailor fell to the floor, lifeless.

Afterward, Maid quickly cleaned the razor and hid it in a nearby drawer, ensuring no one would find it. He then left the Cabin, feigning innocence, and returned to the kitchen to continue his tasks as if nothing had happened. The storm continued to rage outside, providing the perfect cover for his actions, while Maid's heart raced with a mix of fear and exhilaration.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the kitchen, preparing dinner for everyone, when Sailor came in and started making those comments again. It was like she enjoyed putting me down, and I just couldn’t take it anymore. I thought about how she always acted like she was better than everyone else, and it made me feel small. I didn’t want to confront her right away, so I waited until she left for the Cabin. I thought maybe she needed some time alone, but I was also feeling angry and hurt.

When I finally went to the Cabin, the storm was so loud, and I could barely hear anything else. Sailor was pacing, and I could see she was upset. I thought maybe I could talk to her, but then I remembered all those times she belittled me. I just wanted her to understand how it felt. I didn’t mean for things to go that way. I just wanted to make her see me, to make her stop. It all happened so fast. I didn’t even think about what I was doing until it was too late.

Afterward, I was in shock. I cleaned up quickly, hiding the razor where no one would find it. I went back to the kitchen, trying to act normal, like I hadn’t just done something terrible. I thought if I stayed calm, no one would suspect me. The storm was still raging outside, and I felt like it was hiding my secret. I didn’t want anyone to know what had happened. I just wanted to forget.

# Parsed Story for Hunter

Means: Hunter had access to a heavy candlestick in the Conservatory, which could have been used as a weapon.
Motive: None.
Opportunity: Hunter was in the Conservatory, tending to the plants, when the murder occurred.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Hunter was in the Conservatory, meticulously caring for the plants. She found solace in the greenery, especially during the storm, as the sound of the rain was calming. While she worked, she occasionally glanced out the window, watching the lightning illuminate the castle grounds. She was aware of the tension between Sailor and Maid but chose to focus on her task, hoping to avoid any confrontation.

When the murder occurred, Hunter was still in the Conservatory, completely unaware of the events unfolding in the Cabin. The storm was loud, and she was absorbed in her work, pruning leaves and rearranging pots. The thunder masked any sounds of struggle, and she didn’t notice Maid slipping away from the Cabin after the attack. Hunter felt a sense of peace in her sanctuary, oblivious to the chaos that was about to erupt.

Afterward, Hunter left the Conservatory to check on the others, feeling a strange sense of unease. As she walked through the castle, she noticed the atmosphere had shifted; people were whispering and looking anxious. When she reached the kitchen, she found Maid acting unusually calm, which raised her suspicions. Hunter's heart sank as she realized something terrible must have happened, and she hurried to find the others to see if they knew what was going on.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the Conservatory before the murder, tending to the plants. I find it therapeutic to care for them, especially during a storm like this. I was completely focused on my work, trimming leaves and rearranging pots, and I didn’t hear anything unusual. The thunder was so loud that it drowned out any sounds from the Cabin. I didn’t even notice Maid leave the kitchen, and I certainly didn’t see him go after Sailor. I was just trying to keep my mind off things.

When I finished in the Conservatory, I felt a strange sense of unease. I left to check on everyone else, thinking maybe they needed help with the storm. As I walked through the castle, I noticed the atmosphere had changed. People were whispering, and I could sense something was off. When I got to the kitchen, I saw Maid acting strangely calm, which made me suspicious. I had no idea what had happened until I started asking questions.

I want to make it clear that I had no motive to harm Sailor. I admired her spirit, even if she could be a bit blunt at times. I would never want to hurt her. I know there’s a lot of tension between Maid and Sailor, and I think he’s the one you should be looking at. He was always so quiet and seemed to take her comments to heart. I just hope you find the truth soon.


# Parsed Story for Nanny

Means: None
Motive: None
Opportunity: Nanny was in the Study, where she was organizing old papers and books, completely unaware of the murder taking place.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Nanny was in the Study, surrounded by stacks of dusty papers and old books. She was trying to sort through the clutter, feeling grumpy about the state of the castle and her never-ending chores. The storm outside was loud, but it matched her mood as she muttered to herself about the disarray in the household. Nanny was focused on her task, hoping to find some order amidst the chaos, and she didn’t pay attention to the sounds coming from the Cabin.

When the murder occurred, Nanny remained in the Study, engrossed in her work. The thunder and rain masked any noise from the Cabin, and she was completely unaware of the struggle happening just a few rooms away. She occasionally glanced out the window, but her mind was occupied with thoughts of her duties and the mess that needed cleaning. The storm provided a perfect distraction, allowing her to lose herself in her tasks.

Afterward, Nanny finally emerged from the Study, feeling a sense of accomplishment for having organized a portion of the chaos. However, as she walked through the castle, she noticed the tense atmosphere and the worried expressions on the faces of the other household members. When she reached the kitchen, she found Hunter looking anxious and Maid acting strangely calm. Nanny felt a wave of unease wash over her, and she instinctively knew something terrible had happened, but she couldn’t fathom the extent of it.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the Study before the murder, trying to get a handle on the mess that had accumulated over time. I had a lot of papers and books to sort through, and I was feeling quite grumpy about it all. The storm outside was loud, and I was focused on my work, muttering to myself about how chaotic everything was. I didn’t hear anything unusual because I was too busy trying to make sense of the clutter around me.

When the murder happened, I was still in the Study, completely unaware of what was going on. The thunder was so loud that it drowned out any sounds from the Cabin. I was absorbed in my task, and I didn’t notice anyone coming or going. I thought I was alone in the castle, just trying to get through my chores without losing my mind. It wasn’t until later that I realized something was wrong.

After the murder, I left the Study feeling a bit accomplished, but then I noticed the strange atmosphere in the castle. People were whispering and looking anxious, which made me feel uneasy. When I got to the kitchen, I saw Hunter looking worried and Maid acting too calm. I knew something terrible must have happened, but I had no idea what it was. I just want to do my job and keep things running smoothly, but now I feel like I’m being looked at suspiciously for no reason.


# Parsed Story for Miner

Means: None
Motive: None
Opportunity: Miner was in the kitchen when the murder occurred, making him vulnerable to suspicion.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Miner was in the kitchen, nervously preparing a meal for the household. He was anxious about his financial troubles and the possibility of losing his job, which made him fidgety and distracted. While he chopped vegetables, he overheard Sailor and Maid arguing in the background, but he tried to focus on his task, hoping to avoid any confrontation. The storm outside added to his unease, making him feel trapped and on edge.

When the murder occurred, Miner was still in the kitchen, stirring a pot on the stove. The loud thunder and pouring rain drowned out any sounds from the Cabin, so he remained unaware of the struggle happening just a few rooms away. He occasionally glanced out the window, feeling a sense of dread about the storm and the tension in the castle, but he was too preoccupied with his cooking to pay much attention to anything else.

Afterward, Miner finished preparing the meal and stepped out of the kitchen, hoping to find the others and serve dinner. As he walked through the castle, he noticed the atmosphere had shifted; people were whispering and looking anxious. When he reached the dining area, he found Hunter and Nanny looking worried, and Maid acting unusually calm. Miner felt a knot in his stomach as he realized something terrible must have happened, and he instinctively knew he would be a suspect.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the kitchen the whole time, just trying to get dinner ready for everyone. I know it sounds boring, but I was really focused on my work. I heard some arguing between Sailor and Maid, but I didn’t think much of it. I was just chopping vegetables and stirring a pot, trying to keep my mind off my money problems. The storm outside was loud, and I was just hoping it wouldn’t cause any more trouble for us all.

When the murder happened, I had no idea. I was right there in the kitchen, and the thunder was so loud that I couldn’t hear anything else. I was just trying to keep my head down and finish cooking. I didn’t even notice Maid slip away from the Cabin. I was too busy worrying about how I was going to pay my bills and keep my job. I know it sounds suspicious, but I swear I didn’t do anything wrong.

After I finished cooking, I stepped out of the kitchen to see what was going on. I could feel the tension in the air, and it made me nervous. I saw Hunter and Nanny looking worried, and Maid was acting all calm, which didn’t sit right with me. I just wanted to serve dinner and get through the night, but now I’m worried that everyone thinks I had something to do with it. I didn’t, though. I was just trying to keep my head down and do my job.

# Full Prose Prompt

I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

## Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

This is a mystery story in the style of a golden age classic. The story features the following elements:

Victim: Sailor (a 39-year-old woman, short and awkward, who speaks in a blunt manner)
Killer: Maid (a 20-year-old man, tanned and suspicious, who speaks in a whispered manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 46-year-old woman, short and outgoing, who speaks in a whispered manner)

Other Characters:
Hunter (a 41-year-old woman, curly-haired and stoic, who speaks in a enthusiastic manner), Nanny (a 35-year-old woman, curly-haired and grumpy, who speaks in a monotone manner), Miner (a 42-year-old man, short and nervous, who speaks in a casual manner)

It Takes Place In: Gothic castle on a cliff in a rainstorm
The Crime Happened In: Cabin
Other Locations in the Story: Conservatory, Study

The Murder Weapon: Razor
Other Suspicious Items: Grenade

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Razor in the Cabin by Maid, killing Sailor. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In the midst of a thunderous storm, the murder of an outspoken sailor sends shockwaves through a gothic castle perched on a cliff. Detective Detecto must navigate a web of deceit and danger, where every whisper and object, even a seemingly innocuous razor and grenade, may hold the key to unraveling the truth.

Maid's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the kitchen, preparing dinner for everyone, when Sailor came in and started making those comments again. It was like she enjoyed putting me down, and I just couldn’t take it anymore. I thought about how she always acted like she was better than everyone else, and it made me feel small. I didn’t want to confront her right away, so I waited until she left for the Cabin. I thought maybe she needed some time alone, but I was also feeling angry and hurt.

When I finally went to the Cabin, the storm was so loud, and I could barely hear anything else. Sailor was pacing, and I could see she was upset. I thought maybe I could talk to her, but then I remembered all those times she belittled me. I just wanted her to understand how it felt. I didn’t mean for things to go that way. I just wanted to make her see me, to make her stop. It all happened so fast. I didn’t even think about what I was doing until it was too late.

Afterward, I was in shock. I cleaned up quickly, hiding the razor where no one would find it. I went back to the kitchen, trying to act normal, like I hadn’t just done something terrible. I thought if I stayed calm, no one would suspect me. The storm was still raging outside, and I felt like it was hiding my secret. I didn’t want anyone to know what had happened. I just wanted to forget.

Hunter's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the Conservatory before the murder, tending to the plants. I find it therapeutic to care for them, especially during a storm like this. I was completely focused on my work, trimming leaves and rearranging pots, and I didn’t hear anything unusual. The thunder was so loud that it drowned out any sounds from the Cabin. I didn’t even notice Maid leave the kitchen, and I certainly didn’t see him go after Sailor. I was just trying to keep my mind off things.

When I finished in the Conservatory, I felt a strange sense of unease. I left to check on everyone else, thinking maybe they needed help with the storm. As I walked through the castle, I noticed the atmosphere had changed. People were whispering, and I could sense something was off. When I got to the kitchen, I saw Maid acting strangely calm, which made me suspicious. I had no idea what had happened until I started asking questions.

I want to make it clear that I had no motive to harm Sailor. I admired her spirit, even if she could be a bit blunt at times. I would never want to hurt her. I know there’s a lot of tension between Maid and Sailor, and I think he’s the one you should be looking at. He was always so quiet and seemed to take her comments to heart. I just hope you find the truth soon.


Nanny's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the Study before the murder, trying to get a handle on the mess that had accumulated over time. I had a lot of papers and books to sort through, and I was feeling quite grumpy about it all. The storm outside was loud, and I was focused on my work, muttering to myself about how chaotic everything was. I didn’t hear anything unusual because I was too busy trying to make sense of the clutter around me.

When the murder happened, I was still in the Study, completely unaware of what was going on. The thunder was so loud that it drowned out any sounds from the Cabin. I was absorbed in my task, and I didn’t notice anyone coming or going. I thought I was alone in the castle, just trying to get through my chores without losing my mind. It wasn’t until later that I realized something was wrong.

After the murder, I left the Study feeling a bit accomplished, but then I noticed the strange atmosphere in the castle. People were whispering and looking anxious, which made me feel uneasy. When I got to the kitchen, I saw Hunter looking worried and Maid acting too calm. I knew something terrible must have happened, but I had no idea what it was. I just want to do my job and keep things running smoothly, but now I feel like I’m being looked at suspiciously for no reason.


Miner's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the kitchen the whole time, just trying to get dinner ready for everyone. I know it sounds boring, but I was really focused on my work. I heard some arguing between Sailor and Maid, but I didn’t think much of it. I was just chopping vegetables and stirring a pot, trying to keep my mind off my money problems. The storm outside was loud, and I was just hoping it wouldn’t cause any more trouble for us all.

When the murder happened, I had no idea. I was right there in the kitchen, and the thunder was so loud that I couldn’t hear anything else. I was just trying to keep my head down and finish cooking. I didn’t even notice Maid slip away from the Cabin. I was too busy worrying about how I was going to pay my bills and keep my job. I know it sounds suspicious, but I swear I didn’t do anything wrong.

After I finished cooking, I stepped out of the kitchen to see what was going on. I could feel the tension in the air, and it made me nervous. I saw Hunter and Nanny looking worried, and Maid was acting all calm, which didn’t sit right with me. I just wanted to serve dinner and get through the night, but now I’m worried that everyone thinks I had something to do with it. I didn’t, though. I was just trying to keep my head down and do my job.

## Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.
You should use dialog to convey information engage the reader.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point, narrated by Detecto and using dialog where appropriate.

# Full Prose

The rain lashed against the windows of the gothic castle perched precariously on the cliff, a fitting backdrop for the grim scene that awaited me in the Cabin. Sailor lay sprawled on the floor, her life cruelly ended by a razor, the crimson evidence stark against the wooden planks. I, Detective Detecto, arrived at the scene, my whispered voice barely audible over the storm's fury as I began my investigation. 

There were only four people present in the castle: Miner, Nanny, Maid, and Hunter—no one else could have been involved. As I began my inquiries, I noticed Hunter's hands were dirt-streaked, with plant clippings in her apron, suggesting she had been busy in the Conservatory. "I was tending to the plants," Hunter explained, her enthusiastic manner contrasting with the somber mood. Yet, I couldn't help but notice a heavy candlestick in the Conservatory, which could have been used as a weapon, though Hunter made no mention of it.

Maid, on the other hand, seemed to carry a quiet storm within him, much like the one raging outside. "I was in the kitchen, preparing dinner," he protested, his whispered tone attempting to mask the turmoil beneath. But I sensed a deeper story, one of resentment and humiliation at Sailor's hands, which he did not openly confess. The razor, a tool from the kitchen, was sharp and easily concealed, and I surmised it had been used in a moment of anger.

Miner, with his casual demeanor, was in the kitchen during the murder, his favorite apron adorned with a cartoon character. "I didn’t even notice Maid slip away," he admitted, stirring a pot on the stove, oblivious to the chaos that had unfolded. His focus on his financial woes seemed genuine, yet his presence in the kitchen made him vulnerable to suspicion.

Nanny, grumpy and absorbed in her task, was in the Study, sorting through papers and books. "I found an old postcard," she mentioned, a rare smile breaking her monotone as she recalled a happier time. Her alibi seemed solid, confirmed by Hunter, who had seen her engrossed in her work. Yet, the storm had masked any sounds from the Cabin, leaving room for doubt.

As I pieced together the fragments of their stories, I noticed the subtle shifts in the castle's atmosphere. Miner mentioned the anxious whispers and tense glances exchanged among the residents. "I felt a knot in my stomach," he confessed, realizing something terrible had occurred. Nanny, too, observed Hunter's worry and Maid's unsettling calmness, a stark contrast to the storm outside.

Hunter later confirmed Nanny's presence in the Study, reinforcing her innocence. But it was Maid's demeanor that intrigued me most; his calmness seemed a facade, a secret hidden beneath the storm's roar. As I gathered the final pieces of evidence, I knew the truth was within reach. It must be one of these suspects, and I had a strong suspicion of who it was.
