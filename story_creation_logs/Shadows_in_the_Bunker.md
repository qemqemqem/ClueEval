# Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a dagger, which Bartender had taken from a decorative display in the mansion. The dagger was sharp and easily accessible, making it a suitable weapon for a sudden attack.
Motive: Bartender felt overshadowed by Priest's influence within the bunker. They believed that Priest's stoic demeanor and squeaky voice garnered more respect and attention from the other inhabitants, leaving Bartender feeling unappreciated and resentful. This jealousy festered over time, leading Bartender to conclude that removing Priest would elevate their own status among the group.
Opportunity: Priest was vulnerable to attack when she was alone in the shed, tending to some supplies for the greenhouse. The isolation of the shed provided Bartender with the perfect chance to confront Priest without the risk of being interrupted by others.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Bartender was in the mansion, feeling increasingly frustrated by the attention Priest received from the other residents. They paced around the bar area, rehearsing their thoughts and plotting how to confront Priest. As the day wore on, Bartender decided to take a break and headed toward the shed, where they knew Priest would be alone, organizing supplies for the greenhouse. Bartender felt a mix of anger and determination as they approached the shed, dagger hidden in their pocket.

Inside the shed, Priest was focused on her task, unaware of Bartender's arrival. The atmosphere was tense and quiet, with only the sound of rustling materials breaking the silence. Bartender entered the shed, and after a brief exchange, they quickly drew the dagger. In a swift motion, Bartender attacked Priest, catching her off guard. The confrontation was quick and brutal, leaving Priest no time to react or defend herself. Once the deed was done, Bartender stepped back, breathing heavily, and took a moment to collect themselves.

After the murder, Bartender wiped the dagger clean and returned it to its place in the mansion, ensuring it looked undisturbed. They then composed themselves and returned to the bar area, acting as if nothing had happened. Bartender engaged with the other residents, maintaining a facade of normalcy while the reality of their actions loomed heavily in the background. They felt a rush of adrenaline mixed with guilt, but the thrill of having taken control of their situation overshadowed their remorse.


Story to Detective: 


I swear, I had no idea what was going to happen that day. I was just minding my own business, you know? I was in the mansion, cleaning up the bar and trying to keep things running smoothly. Priest was always there, acting all high and mighty, and it just got under my skin. I mean, who does she think she is? I was feeling a bit overwhelmed, so I decided to take a break and clear my head. I thought maybe I’d go check on the supplies in the shed, just to see if I could help out. It was all innocent, really.

When I got to the shed, I found Priest there, busy with her tasks. I didn’t mean to start anything; I just wanted to see if she needed help. But then, I don’t know, something just snapped. I felt this rush of frustration and anger. I didn’t even think about it; I just reacted. I pulled out the dagger, but it was all so fast. I didn’t want to hurt her, but it was like I was in a daze. I thought maybe if I confronted her, I could finally get some respect. But it all spiraled out of control, and before I knew it, it was done. I didn’t plan for it to happen like that.

Afterward, I was in shock. I cleaned up as best as I could, trying to make sure everything looked normal. I put the dagger back where it belonged, and then I just went back to the bar. I acted like nothing was wrong, you know? I didn’t want anyone to suspect anything. I was just trying to keep my cool and not draw attention to myself. I swear, I didn’t mean for any of this to happen. I’m just a bartender trying to do my job.

# Parsed Story for Teacher

Means: Teacher had access to a bat that was stored in the shed, but they did not use it.
Motive: None.
Opportunity: Teacher was in the greenhouse, tending to the plants, when the murder occurred.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Teacher was in the greenhouse, focused on caring for the plants. They were known for their outgoing nature and often engaged with the other residents, but today, they were particularly absorbed in their work. Teacher had been feeling a mix of emotions regarding Priest, who had been receiving a lot of attention from others, and they were trying to distract themselves by tending to the flowers. However, they were also aware of the tension brewing between Bartender and Priest, which made them uneasy.

When the murder occurred, Teacher was still in the greenhouse, unaware of the violent act taking place in the shed. They were busy watering the plants and organizing the tools, occasionally glancing toward the shed, but they did not hear any commotion. Teacher had a clear view of the area but was too preoccupied with their task to notice anything unusual. They felt a sense of relief in the solitude of the greenhouse, thinking it was a safe space away from the brewing conflict.

After the murder, Teacher returned to the mansion, feeling a strange sense of foreboding. They noticed the atmosphere had shifted, and the other residents seemed on edge. Teacher tried to engage with them, but their mind was still on Priest and the strange tension with Bartender. When they learned about the murder, Teacher was shocked and horrified, feeling guilty for not having been there to protect Priest. They quickly became aware that their previous interactions with Priest could be misinterpreted, making them feel even more anxious about how others perceived them.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the greenhouse before the murder, tending to the plants. I often find solace in my work, especially when things get tense among the residents. I had noticed the growing friction between Bartender and Priest, but I thought it best to keep my distance and focus on the flowers. I was completely absorbed in my task, watering and organizing tools, and I didn’t hear anything unusual coming from the shed. I was unaware that anything was amiss until later.

When I returned to the mansion after my work, I sensed a change in the atmosphere. The other residents seemed uneasy, and I could feel the tension in the air. I tried to engage with them, but it was as if everyone was holding their breath. I had no idea that Priest had been killed until someone mentioned it. I was shocked and horrified, feeling a sense of guilt for not being there to help. I can’t believe something so terrible happened while I was just a few steps away.

I want to make it clear that I had no motive to harm Priest. Our relationship was complicated, but I cared for her deeply. I know my actions might seem suspicious, especially since I was in the vicinity, but I assure you I had no part in this. I think you should look more closely at Bartender. They were always on edge, and I sensed something was off about them. I just hope you can see that I had no reason to want Priest dead.

I understand that my past with Priest might make me seem suspicious, but I assure you, I had no reason to hurt her.

# Full Prose Prompt

I'm writing a murder mystery short story. I'm going to show you my notes for reference, then I'm going to outline the story that I want to write.

## Notes

Here are my notes. It's a lot of background, most of which will not make its way into the final story, but I want you to see it.

This is a mystery story in the style of a golden age classic. The story features the following elements:

Victim: Priest (a 35-year-old woman, redhead and stoic, who speaks in a squeaky manner)
Killer: Bartender (a 37-year-old non-binary person, tanned and suspicious, who speaks in a rapid-fire manner)
The Detective: Detecto (a 37-year-old man, brunette and stuttering, who speaks in a mumbling manner)

Other Characters:
Teacher (a 46-year-old man, muscular and outgoing, who speaks in a whispered manner), Actor (a 53-year-old woman, pale and meticulous, who speaks in a gravelly manner), Accountant (a 18-year-old woman, pale and awkward, who speaks in a formal manner)

It Takes Place In: Sealed underground bunker
The Crime Happened In: Shed
Other Locations in the Story: Greenhouse, Mansion

The Murder Weapon: Dagger
Other Suspicious Items: Bat

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Dagger in the Shed by Bartender, killing Priest. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: When a priest is found brutally murdered in an isolated shed, stuttering Detective Detecto is brought in to unravel the mystery within a sealed underground bunker. As he navigates through a web of deception and uncovers the eerie interconnectedness of the inhabitants, he must determine if the suspicious bartender is truly the killer, or if there's more to this chilling mystery than meets the eye.

Bartender's Story to the Detective: 


I swear, I had no idea what was going to happen that day. I was just minding my own business, you know? I was in the mansion, cleaning up the bar and trying to keep things running smoothly. Priest was always there, acting all high and mighty, and it just got under my skin. I mean, who does she think she is? I was feeling a bit overwhelmed, so I decided to take a break and clear my head. I thought maybe I’d go check on the supplies in the shed, just to see if I could help out. It was all innocent, really.

When I got to the shed, I found Priest there, busy with her tasks. I didn’t mean to start anything; I just wanted to see if she needed help. But then, I don’t know, something just snapped. I felt this rush of frustration and anger. I didn’t even think about it; I just reacted. I pulled out the dagger, but it was all so fast. I didn’t want to hurt her, but it was like I was in a daze. I thought maybe if I confronted her, I could finally get some respect. But it all spiraled out of control, and before I knew it, it was done. I didn’t plan for it to happen like that.

Afterward, I was in shock. I cleaned up as best as I could, trying to make sure everything looked normal. I put the dagger back where it belonged, and then I just went back to the bar. I acted like nothing was wrong, you know? I didn’t want anyone to suspect anything. I was just trying to keep my cool and not draw attention to myself. I swear, I didn’t mean for any of this to happen. I’m just a bartender trying to do my job.

Teacher's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the greenhouse before the murder, tending to the plants. I often find solace in my work, especially when things get tense among the residents. I had noticed the growing friction between Bartender and Priest, but I thought it best to keep my distance and focus on the flowers. I was completely absorbed in my task, watering and organizing tools, and I didn’t hear anything unusual coming from the shed. I was unaware that anything was amiss until later.

When I returned to the mansion after my work, I sensed a change in the atmosphere. The other residents seemed uneasy, and I could feel the tension in the air. I tried to engage with them, but it was as if everyone was holding their breath. I had no idea that Priest had been killed until someone mentioned it. I was shocked and horrified, feeling a sense of guilt for not being there to help. I can’t believe something so terrible happened while I was just a few steps away.

I want to make it clear that I had no motive to harm Priest. Our relationship was complicated, but I cared for her deeply. I know my actions might seem suspicious, especially since I was in the vicinity, but I assure you I had no part in this. I think you should look more closely at Bartender. They were always on edge, and I sensed something was off about them. I just hope you can see that I had no reason to want Priest dead.


Actor's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the main hall rehearsing my lines for an upcoming performance when the murder happened. I was completely focused on my craft, pacing back and forth, trying to get my delivery just right. I didn’t hear anything unusual coming from the shed. I was so engrossed in my performance that I lost track of time and didn’t notice the tension that had been building between Bartender and Priest. I assure you, I had no idea anything was wrong until I finished and stepped outside.

When I finally left the main hall, I felt a strange shift in the atmosphere. The other residents were whispering, and I could sense something was off. It wasn’t until I learned about Priest’s murder that I felt a wave of shock and horror wash over me. I had a past with Priest, but it was long over, and I had no motive to harm her. I was just trying to focus on my performance, and I would never wish her any harm.

I understand that my past with Priest might make me seem suspicious, but I assure you, I had no reason to hurt her. I was in the main hall the entire time, rehearsing, and I didn’t even have a weapon. You should really look into Bartender; they were the last person seen with Priest, and I noticed they were acting strangely before the murder. I’m just as shocked as everyone else, and I want to help find the truth.


Accountant's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the study, organizing the financial records for the residents when the murder happened. I had my door closed because I needed to concentrate, and I was so focused on my work that I didn’t hear anything outside. I know there was tension between Bartender and Priest, but I thought it was best to stay out of it and focus on my responsibilities. I felt overwhelmed by the pressure of managing the accounts, and I didn’t want to get involved in any conflicts.

When I finished my work, I stepped out of the study to take a break. I was hoping to find someone to talk to, but as I walked through the mansion, I noticed that everyone seemed on edge. The atmosphere felt heavy, and I could sense something was wrong. I had no idea that a murder had taken place until I heard the news. I was shocked and horrified, and I felt guilty for not being there to help Priest.

I want to assure you that I had no motive to harm Priest. I admired her strength and stoicism, and I often felt inadequate in comparison. I know that my behavior might seem suspicious, but I was simply trying to focus on my work. I didn’t have any weapon or means to commit such an act, and I was completely unaware of the events unfolding in the shed. I believe Bartender was acting strangely, and I think you should look into their behavior more closely.

## Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.
You should use dialog to convey information engage the reader.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point, narrated by Detecto and using dialog where appropriate.

# Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the sealed underground bunker, his stuttering voice barely audible as he mumbled to himself about the grim scene awaiting him. The victim, Priest, lay lifeless on the floor of the shed, a dagger protruding from her chest, blood pooling around her in a macabre display. Only four people were present in this isolated setting: Accountant, Teacher, Bartender, and Actor, and no one else could have possibly been involved.

Detecto began his investigation by questioning the Accountant, who mentioned, "I know there was tension between Bartender and Priest." As Detecto observed the Accountant, he noticed her humming a catchy jingle from a childhood commercial, a detail she hadn't mentioned but revealed her state of mind during her work in the mansion. The Actor, when questioned, protested her innocence, saying, "I was in the main hall rehearsing my lines, completely unaware of what was happening in the shed."

Detecto's keen eye caught the Actor's momentary amusement as she recounted tripping over a loose floorboard during her rehearsal, a detail she hadn't intended to share. The Actor also mentioned her favorite mug, adorned with a quirky cartoon character, which she always used for coffee. Meanwhile, Bartender, pacing around the bar area, commented on a vibrant painting of a sunset, a detail that seemed to brighten the room despite the grim circumstances.

Bartender, too, protested innocence, claiming, "I didn’t want to hurt her, but it was like I was in a daze." Detecto noticed Bartender's subtle glances at the decorative display from which the dagger had been taken, a clue that hinted at their concealed knowledge of the weapon's origin. Teacher, tending to the plants in the greenhouse, expressed anxiety about how others perceived them after the murder, a sentiment that seemed genuine.

Detecto observed the untouched bat in the shed, noting that Teacher had no access to the dagger used in the murder. The Accountant's demeanor, confirmed by witnesses, was one of shock rather than guilt or fear, as she recounted, "When I finished my work, I stepped out of the study to take a break." The Actor reiterated, "I was in the main hall the entire time, rehearsing, and I didn’t even have a weapon."

Bartender mentioned noticing the faint smell of fresh paint lingering in the air from a recent renovation in the mansion, a detail that seemed oddly specific. Teacher, returning to the mansion after the murder, remarked on the shifted atmosphere, feeling guilty for not having been there to protect Priest. As Teacher protested innocence, Detecto's mind pieced together the subtle clues and inconsistencies.

With each interview, Detecto's understanding of the events deepened, and he knew that one of these suspects was responsible for the crime. As he prepared to announce his conclusion, the truth of the murder in the sealed underground bunker began to crystallize in his mind.
