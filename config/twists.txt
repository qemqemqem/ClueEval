The killer is actually the victim in disguise
The detective is the real killer
The murder weapon is something completely unexpected
The crime scene is not where the murder actually took place
There are two killers working together
The victim faked their own death
The motive is completely different from what was initially assumed
A seemingly unimportant character turns out to be the mastermind
The murder was an accident, not intentional
The killer has an identical twin who provided an alibi
The victim was already dead before the "murder" occurred
The murder was committed by a person who doesn't exist
The detective's trusted assistant is involved in the crime
The killer is someone who was thought to be dead
The murder weapon is something that doesn't exist in the time period
The victim is not who everyone thought they were
The entire crime was elaborately staged for a hidden purpose
The last person you'd suspect turns out to be the killer
The killer has multiple personalities, one of which committed the crime
The murder was actually a suicide made to look like murder
