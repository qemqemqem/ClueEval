# Garrote in the Snow

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the snowbound mountain chalet, his grey hair dusted with snowflakes, and his nerves on edge as he surveyed the grim scene before him: the lifeless body of the waiter sprawled on the hotel floor, a garrote cruelly wrapped around his neck. The room was silent, save for the howling wind outside, as Detecto took in the sight of the four potential suspects: the Chauffeur, the Musician, the Hunter, and the Miner, each with their own secrets to conceal. 

Detecto began his investigation by questioning the Chauffeur, who claimed she was in the garage, isolated from the hotel, when the murder took place. "I was just listening to my favorite playlist," she squeaked, her voice as meticulous as her freckled appearance, "classic rock always helps me focus on my work." 

Turning to Hunter, Detecto noted the man's nervous pacing as he recounted his time in the kitchen, watching Waiter charm the guests. "I needed a break," Hunter insisted, "so I went to the storage room to clear my head." Detecto observed the flicker of resentment in Hunter's eyes, a hint of the deep-seated envy that simmered beneath his protestations of innocence.

Hunter's story was further complicated by his mention of a peculiar stain on the kitchen floor, a detail that seemed oddly out of place amidst the chaos. The Miner, with her friendly demeanor, recounted her time in the dining area, ensuring the guests were content, unaware of the tragedy unfolding nearby. "I was just trying to keep everyone happy," she said, her verbosity masking the tension Detecto sensed beneath her words.

Detecto's attention shifted to the Musician, who admitted to a minor argument with Waiter over a misplaced order. "It was nothing serious," he shrugged, strumming an imaginary guitar string, "I was just focused on my performance." Yet, Detecto couldn't ignore the Musician's access to a bat from the hotel's entertainment room, a potential weapon that added another layer of intrigue to the case.

As Detecto pieced together the stories, he discovered the garage door had been locked from the inside during the murder, confirming the Chauffeur's alibi. The Miner, meanwhile, recalled the storm outside, which had prompted guests to joke about the weather, likening it to a scene from a horror movie. "I was in the kitchen when I heard the commotion," she explained, her eagerness to assist only heightening Detecto's suspicions.

The Musician, oblivious to the unfolding drama, claimed he noticed the staff's worried expressions only after the fact. "I was just trying to keep the good vibes going," he said, his casual manner contrasting sharply with the tension Detecto felt in the room. The Chauffeur, too, had sensed the unease, her freckled face betraying her anxiety as she inquired about the situation.

Detecto noted the intricate patterns of snowflakes on the garage window, a detail the Chauffeur had admired, further corroborating her story. The Miner, returning to the kitchen, felt the atmosphere shift, her friendly nature inadvertently casting suspicion upon her. "I just want to help," she insisted, her protestations of innocence echoing those of her fellow suspects.

As Detecto gathered the final pieces of the puzzle, he knew that one of these individuals held the key to the waiter's untimely demise. With the evidence laid bare before him, Detecto was ready to reveal the truth, confident in his ability to untangle the web of deceit that had ensnared them all.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Waiter?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Chauffeur
- B: Musician
- C: Miner
- D: Hunter

## Correct Answer

The killer is Hunter

## Reasoning

- [DURING_CRIME]	The detective finds the garage door locked from the inside during the time of the murder, confirming that Chauffeur was not in the hotel. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Chauffeur)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	When I heard the commotion after the murder, I was in the kitchen helping prepare the next course. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Miner)
- [DURING_CRIME]	I had no idea anything was wrong until I noticed the staff rushing around looking worried. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Musician)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Hunter felt overshadowed by Waiter’s cheerful demeanor and popularity among the guests. He believed that Waiter was mocking him, and he harbored a deep-seated resentment that festered over time. Hunter wanted to eliminate what he perceived as a threat to his own self-worth and standing within the hotel. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Hunter)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a garrote, a simple yet effective tool that Hunter had access to in the hotel’s maintenance area. It was a thin wire that could be easily concealed and used to strangle someone quickly and quietly. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Hunter)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Waiter was vulnerable when he was alone in the hotel’s storage room, preparing supplies for the evening service. The timing was perfect, as the other staff members were busy attending to guests, leaving Waiter isolated and unsuspecting. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Hunter)

### Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a garrote, a simple yet effective tool that Hunter had access to in the hotel’s maintenance area. It was a thin wire that could be easily concealed and used to strangle someone quickly and quietly.
Motive: Hunter felt overshadowed by Waiter’s cheerful demeanor and popularity among the guests. He believed that Waiter was mocking him, and he harbored a deep-seated resentment that festered over time. Hunter wanted to eliminate what he perceived as a threat to his own self-worth and standing within the hotel.
Opportunity: Waiter was vulnerable when he was alone in the hotel’s storage room, preparing supplies for the evening service. The timing was perfect, as the other staff members were busy attending to guests, leaving Waiter isolated and unsuspecting.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Hunter was in the hotel’s kitchen, nervously pacing as he watched Waiter interact with the guests. Waiter’s laughter and charm grated on Hunter’s nerves, and he felt increasingly agitated. As the evening approached, Hunter decided to take a break and slipped away to the storage room, where he knew Waiter would be preparing supplies. He waited for the right moment, his heart racing with a mix of anxiety and determination.

When Waiter entered the storage room, humming to himself, Hunter seized the opportunity. He approached from behind, using the garrote he had taken from the maintenance area. In a swift motion, he wrapped the wire around Waiter’s neck, pulling tight. Waiter struggled briefly, but the element of surprise worked in Hunter’s favor, and within moments, the jovial young man fell silent. Hunter stood there for a moment, breathless and shocked by the gravity of what he had just done.

Afterward, Hunter quickly disposed of the garrote in a nearby trash bin and returned to the kitchen, attempting to act as if nothing had happened. He joined the other staff members, feigning normalcy while his mind raced with panic. As the evening unfolded, he kept a close eye on the other employees, worried that someone might suspect him. He even engaged in conversation with the Miner and the Musician, trying to blend in, all the while feeling the weight of his secret pressing down on him.


Story to Detective: 


In my account, I must emphasize that I was merely a bystander in the unfortunate events that transpired that evening. I had been in the kitchen, preparing for the dinner rush, when I noticed Waiter bustling about, charming the guests with his incessant banter. It was impossible not to feel a twinge of envy as I watched him bask in the attention, but I assure you, I had no ill intentions toward him. My focus was solely on my duties, and I had no reason to engage with him beyond the usual pleasantries.

When I left the kitchen, I decided to take a moment to gather my thoughts in the storage room. It was a quiet space, and I thought it might help me clear my mind. I was startled when I found Waiter there, seemingly lost in his own world. I must admit, I felt a surge of frustration at his carefree attitude, but I would never act on such feelings. I simply stood there, trying to compose myself, when he turned to me with that infuriatingly cheerful grin. It was at that moment that I felt overwhelmed, but I assure you, I did not harm him in any way.

After our brief encounter, I returned to the kitchen, where I was met with the usual hustle and bustle of preparing for dinner. I was anxious, yes, but only because I wanted everything to go smoothly. I engaged with my colleagues, trying to maintain a sense of normalcy, and I was genuinely shocked when I heard the commotion about Waiter. I can only express my disbelief at the situation, as I had no part in it whatsoever. I am simply a victim of circumstance, caught up in a tragic event that I had no control over.

As she worked, she organized tools and cleaned the car, humming to herself in a way that kept her spirits high despite the snowstorm raging outside. She was focused on her task, ensuring that every detail was perfect, as she took pride in her work.

When the murder occurred, Chauffeur was still in the garage, completely unaware of the events unfolding in the hotel. She had her back turned, engrossed in her work, and the sounds of the storm outside masked any noise that might have come from the hotel. The garage was a separate area, and she had no reason to suspect anything was amiss, as she was busy preparing for the next day’s journey.

After the murder, Chauffeur finished her work in the garage and decided to check on the hotel staff, thinking they might need assistance with the evening’s service. As she entered the hotel, she noticed the tension in the air and the worried expressions on the faces of the other employees. Concerned, she asked if everything was alright, but her freckled face and meticulous demeanor made her seem overly anxious, raising suspicion among the others.

I take my responsibilities very seriously, and I wanted to ensure that everything was in perfect order. I was focused on my work, checking the oil and cleaning the windows, completely unaware of what was happening inside the hotel. The storm outside was quite loud, and I didn’t hear anything unusual. I was just doing my job, as I always do.

When I finished in the garage, I thought it would be a good idea to check on the staff. I walked into the hotel and immediately sensed the tension in the air. Everyone looked worried, and I felt a knot in my stomach. I asked if everything was alright, but I could see that my presence only added to the unease. I didn’t mean to seem suspicious; I was just concerned for my colleagues. I know how important it is to keep things running smoothly, especially in a place like this.

I must admit, I noticed Hunter acting a bit strange when I returned. He seemed overly nervous, and I couldn’t help but wonder if he was hiding something.

I hope you can see that my actions were innocent, even if they may have appeared suspicious.

She wanted to impress the guests and her fellow staff members, so she was determined to make the evening perfect.

When the murder occurred, Miner was still in the dining area, serving drinks and chatting with guests. She was completely unaware of the events unfolding in the storage room. The sounds of the storm outside and the clinking of glasses drowned out any noise that might have come from the back of the hotel. Her focus was on her duties, and she was engaged in conversation with a few guests, laughing and trying to keep the mood light.

After the murder, Miner noticed a sudden shift in the atmosphere as she returned to the kitchen to help with the preparations.

Motive: None

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Musician was in the hotel’s dining area, entertaining guests with his guitar. He was in high spirits, joking and playing lively tunes to keep the atmosphere cheerful despite the storm outside. However, earlier in the evening, he had a minor argument with Waiter over a misplaced order, which left him feeling a bit irritable. He brushed it off, focusing on his performance and trying to engage the guests, but the tension from the argument lingered in the back of his mind.

When the murder occurred, Musician was still in the dining area, surrounded by guests who were laughing and enjoying his music. The sounds of the storm and the clinking of glasses drowned out any noise from the storage room, where Waiter was attacked. Musician was completely unaware of the events unfolding just a few feet away, as he was engrossed in his performance and the lively atmosphere created by the guests. His focus was on entertaining, and he had no reason to suspect anything was wrong.

After the murder, Musician noticed a sudden change in the mood of the staff as they rushed in and out of the kitchen, whispering anxiously. He finished his set and put down his guitar, feeling a knot in his stomach as he approached the kitchen to see what was happening. When he learned about Waiter’s death, he felt a wave of guilt wash over him, thinking about their earlier argument. He tried to help calm the other staff members, but his eagerness to assist only made him seem more suspicious in the eyes of those around him.


Story to Detective: 


I was just doing my job, playing music for the guests in the dining area before the murder happened. I was in a good mood, trying to keep everyone entertained despite the storm outside. Sure, I had a little spat with Waiter earlier about a misplaced order, but it was nothing serious. I didn’t want him dead or anything like that; it was just a silly argument. I was focused on my performance, and I didn’t hear anything unusual while I was playing. The guests were laughing and enjoying themselves, and I was just trying to keep the good vibes going.

When the murder took place, I was right there in the dining area, surrounded by people. I had no idea anything was wrong until I noticed the staff rushing around looking worried. I was completely oblivious to what was happening in the storage room. I mean, how could I have known? The storm was loud, and I was busy playing my guitar. I didn’t have any opportunity to commit the crime, and I certainly didn’t have a motive. I just wanted to make sure everyone was having a good time.

After I found out about Waiter’s death, I felt terrible. I rushed to the kitchen to see if I could help, but everyone seemed so tense. I tried to reassure them, but I could tell that my eagerness to assist only made me look more suspicious. I didn’t do anything wrong, and I hope you can see that. I just want to clear my name and help find out who really did this. It’s a terrible thing that happened, and I can’t believe it.

Synopsis: A jovial waiter's life comes to a sudden end at a secluded mountain chalet hotel, strangled by a garrote. It's up to the nervous yet articulate Detective Detecto to unravel the mystery amidst the snowbound landscape and a colorful array of suspects, where everyone seems to have something to hide. Will he be able to untangle the truth before the snow melts?

Hunter's Story to the Detective: 


In my account, I must emphasize that I was merely a bystander in the unfortunate events that transpired that evening. I had been in the kitchen, preparing for the dinner rush, when I noticed Waiter bustling about, charming the guests with his incessant banter. It was impossible not to feel a twinge of envy as I watched him bask in the attention, but I assure you, I had no ill intentions toward him. My focus was solely on my duties, and I had no reason to engage with him beyond the usual pleasantries.

When I left the kitchen, I decided to take a moment to gather my thoughts in the storage room. It was a quiet space, and I thought it might help me clear my mind. I was startled when I found Waiter there, seemingly lost in his own world. I must admit, I felt a surge of frustration at his carefree attitude, but I would never act on such feelings. I simply stood there, trying to compose myself, when he turned to me with that infuriatingly cheerful grin. It was at that moment that I felt overwhelmed, but I assure you, I did not harm him in any way.

After our brief encounter, I returned to the kitchen, where I was met with the usual hustle and bustle of preparing for dinner. I was anxious, yes, but only because I wanted everything to go smoothly. I engaged with my colleagues, trying to maintain a sense of normalcy, and I was genuinely shocked when I heard the commotion about Waiter. I can only express my disbelief at the situation, as I had no part in it whatsoever. I am simply a victim of circumstance, caught up in a tragic event that I had no control over.

Chauffeur's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the garage preparing the vehicle for an early morning departure when the unfortunate incident occurred. I take my responsibilities very seriously, and I wanted to ensure that everything was in perfect order. I was focused on my work, checking the oil and cleaning the windows, completely unaware of what was happening inside the hotel. The storm outside was quite loud, and I didn’t hear anything unusual. I was just doing my job, as I always do.

When I finished in the garage, I thought it would be a good idea to check on the staff. I walked into the hotel and immediately sensed the tension in the air. Everyone looked worried, and I felt a knot in my stomach. I asked if everything was alright, but I could see that my presence only added to the unease. I didn’t mean to seem suspicious; I was just concerned for my colleagues. I know how important it is to keep things running smoothly, especially in a place like this.

I must admit, I noticed Hunter acting a bit strange when I returned. He seemed overly nervous, and I couldn’t help but wonder if he was hiding something. But I assure you, I had no motive to harm the waiter. I was simply doing my job, and I would never dream of causing anyone harm. I hope you can see that my actions were innocent, even if they may have appeared suspicious.


Miner's Story to the Detective: 


In my mind, I was just doing my job, trying to keep everything running smoothly in the dining area. I was serving drinks and chatting with the guests, making sure they were happy and comfortable. I had no idea that anything was happening in the storage room. I was focused on the guests, and I thought everything was going well. I even overheard some complaints about the service earlier, which made me anxious, but I was determined to turn things around and make the evening enjoyable for everyone.

When I heard the commotion after the murder, I was in the kitchen helping prepare the next course. I didn’t know what had happened until I saw the worried faces of my colleagues. I wanted to help, but I could feel the tension in the air. I approached the others to ask what was wrong, but I could tell that my eagerness to assist made me seem suspicious. I was just trying to be friendly and supportive, but I could see that my actions were being misinterpreted.

I want to assure you that I had no motive to harm the waiter. I was focused on my work and trying to keep the guests happy. I know that Hunter was acting a bit strange, and I noticed he seemed nervous throughout the evening. Perhaps you should look into him more closely. I just want to clear my name and help find out what really happened.


Musician's Story to the Detective: 


I was just doing my job, playing music for the guests in the dining area before the murder happened. I was in a good mood, trying to keep everyone entertained despite the storm outside. Sure, I had a little spat with Waiter earlier about a misplaced order, but it was nothing serious. I didn’t want him dead or anything like that; it was just a silly argument. I was focused on my performance, and I didn’t hear anything unusual while I was playing. The guests were laughing and enjoying themselves, and I was just trying to keep the good vibes going.

When the murder took place, I was right there in the dining area, surrounded by people. I had no idea anything was wrong until I noticed the staff rushing around looking worried. I was completely oblivious to what was happening in the storage room. I mean, how could I have known? The storm was loud, and I was busy playing my guitar. I didn’t have any opportunity to commit the crime, and I certainly didn’t have a motive. I just wanted to make sure everyone was having a good time.

After I found out about Waiter’s death, I felt terrible. I rushed to the kitchen to see if I could help, but everyone seemed so tense. I tried to reassure them, but I could tell that my eagerness to assist only made me look more suspicious. I didn’t do anything wrong, and I hope you can see that. I just want to clear my name and help find out who really did this. It’s a terrible thing that happened, and I can’t believe it.

#### Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.
You should use dialog to convey information engage the reader.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point, narrated by Detecto and using dialog where appropriate.

### Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the snowbound mountain chalet, his grey hair dusted with snowflakes, and his nerves on edge as he surveyed the grim scene before him: the lifeless body of the waiter sprawled on the hotel floor, a garrote cruelly wrapped around his neck. The room was silent, save for the howling wind outside, as Detecto took in the sight of the four potential suspects: the Chauffeur, the Musician, the Hunter, and the Miner, each with their own secrets to conceal. 

Detecto began his investigation by questioning the Chauffeur, who claimed she was in the garage, isolated from the hotel, when the murder took place. "I was just listening to my favorite playlist," she squeaked, her voice as meticulous as her freckled appearance, "classic rock always helps me focus on my work." 

Turning to Hunter, Detecto noted the man's nervous pacing as he recounted his time in the kitchen, watching Waiter charm the guests. "I needed a break," Hunter insisted, "so I went to the storage room to clear my head." Detecto observed the flicker of resentment in Hunter's eyes, a hint of the deep-seated envy that simmered beneath his protestations of innocence.

Hunter's story was further complicated by his mention of a peculiar stain on the kitchen floor, a detail that seemed oddly out of place amidst the chaos. The Miner, with her friendly demeanor, recounted her time in the dining area, ensuring the guests were content, unaware of the tragedy unfolding nearby. "I was just trying to keep everyone happy," she said, her verbosity masking the tension Detecto sensed beneath her words.

Detecto's attention shifted to the Musician, who admitted to a minor argument with Waiter over a misplaced order. "It was nothing serious," he shrugged, strumming an imaginary guitar string, "I was just focused on my performance." Yet, Detecto couldn't ignore the Musician's access to a bat from the hotel's entertainment room, a potential weapon that added another layer of intrigue to the case.

As Detecto pieced together the stories, he discovered the garage door had been locked from the inside during the murder, confirming the Chauffeur's alibi. The Miner, meanwhile, recalled the storm outside, which had prompted guests to joke about the weather, likening it to a scene from a horror movie. "I was in the kitchen when I heard the commotion," she explained, her eagerness to assist only heightening Detecto's suspicions.

The Musician, oblivious to the unfolding drama, claimed he noticed the staff's worried expressions only after the fact. "I was just trying to keep the good vibes going," he said, his casual manner contrasting sharply with the tension Detecto felt in the room. The Chauffeur, too, had sensed the unease, her freckled face betraying her anxiety as she inquired about the situation.

Detecto noted the intricate patterns of snowflakes on the garage window, a detail the Chauffeur had admired, further corroborating her story. The Miner, returning to the kitchen, felt the atmosphere shift, her friendly nature inadvertently casting suspicion upon her. "I just want to help," she insisted, her protestations of innocence echoing those of her fellow suspects.

As Detecto gathered the final pieces of the puzzle, he knew that one of these individuals held the key to the waiter's untimely demise. With the evidence laid bare before him, Detecto was ready to reveal the truth, confident in his ability to untangle the web of deceit that had ensnared them all.
