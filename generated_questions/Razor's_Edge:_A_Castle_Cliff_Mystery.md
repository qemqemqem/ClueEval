# Razor's Edge: A Castle Cliff Mystery

## Full Story

The rain lashed against the windows of the gothic castle perched precariously on the cliff, a fitting backdrop for the grim scene that awaited me in the Cabin. Sailor lay sprawled on the floor, her life cruelly ended by a razor, the crimson evidence stark against the wooden planks. I, Detective Detecto, arrived at the scene, my whispered voice barely audible over the storm's fury as I began my investigation. 

There were only four people present in the castle: Miner, Nanny, Maid, and Hunter—no one else could have been involved. As I began my inquiries, I noticed Hunter's hands were dirt-streaked, with plant clippings in her apron, suggesting she had been busy in the Conservatory. "I was tending to the plants," Hunter explained, her enthusiastic manner contrasting with the somber mood. Yet, I couldn't help but notice a heavy candlestick in the Conservatory, which could have been used as a weapon, though Hunter made no mention of it.

Maid, on the other hand, seemed to carry a quiet storm within him, much like the one raging outside. "I was in the kitchen, preparing dinner," he protested, his whispered tone attempting to mask the turmoil beneath. But I sensed a deeper story, one of resentment and humiliation at Sailor's hands, which he did not openly confess. The razor, a tool from the kitchen, was sharp and easily concealed, and I surmised it had been used in a moment of anger.

Miner, with his casual demeanor, was in the kitchen during the murder, his favorite apron adorned with a cartoon character. "I didn’t even notice Maid slip away," he admitted, stirring a pot on the stove, oblivious to the chaos that had unfolded. His focus on his financial woes seemed genuine, yet his presence in the kitchen made him vulnerable to suspicion.

Nanny, grumpy and absorbed in her task, was in the Study, sorting through papers and books. "I found an old postcard," she mentioned, a rare smile breaking her monotone as she recalled a happier time. Her alibi seemed solid, confirmed by Hunter, who had seen her engrossed in her work. Yet, the storm had masked any sounds from the Cabin, leaving room for doubt.

As I pieced together the fragments of their stories, I noticed the subtle shifts in the castle's atmosphere. Miner mentioned the anxious whispers and tense glances exchanged among the residents. "I felt a knot in my stomach," he confessed, realizing something terrible had occurred. Nanny, too, observed Hunter's worry and Maid's unsettling calmness, a stark contrast to the storm outside.

Hunter later confirmed Nanny's presence in the Study, reinforcing her innocence. But it was Maid's demeanor that intrigued me most; his calmness seemed a facade, a secret hidden beneath the storm's roar. As I gathered the final pieces of evidence, I knew the truth was within reach. It must be one of these suspects, and I had a strong suspicion of who it was.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Sailor?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Nanny
- B: Maid
- C: Miner
- D: Hunter

## Correct Answer

The killer is Maid

## Reasoning

- [DURING_CRIME]	Hunter was found in the Conservatory with dirt under her nails and plant clippings in her apron, indicating she had been working there and had no time to commit the murder. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Hunter)
- [AFTER_CRIME]	Hunter later confirms that she saw Nanny in the Study, focused on her work, and did not leave until after the murder occurred. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Nanny)
- [DURING_CRIME]	When the murder occurred, Miner was still in the kitchen, stirring a pot on the stove. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Miner)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Maid felt overshadowed by Sailor's brash personality and blunt manner. Sailor often belittled Maid's contributions around the castle, making him feel inadequate and resentful. The constant humiliation and Sailor's dismissive attitude fueled a desire for revenge. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Maid)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a razor, a tool that Maid had access to in the castle's kitchen. It was sharp and easily concealed, making it a suitable weapon for a sudden attack. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Maid)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Sailor was vulnerable when she retreated to the Cabin after a heated argument with Maid. The storm outside created a cacophony of noise, masking any sounds of struggle, and the isolation of the Cabin made it easy for Maid to approach without being seen. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Maid)
