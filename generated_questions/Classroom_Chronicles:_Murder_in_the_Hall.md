# Classroom Chronicles: Murder in the Hall

## Full Story

Detective Detecto arrived at the exclusive boarding school, his curly hair slightly tousled by the brisk wind, to find Hunter's lifeless body sprawled on the floor of the hall, a lead pipe lying ominously nearby, stained with blood. The scene was grim, and the detective's suspicious eyes scanned the room, noting the presence of four individuals: the Accountant, the Priest, the Butler, and the Farmer. No one else could possibly have been there, and Detecto knew that the truth lay among these four.

Detecto began his investigation by questioning the Accountant, who admitted to having a brief but heated argument with Hunter earlier in the day. Despite her protests of innocence, Detecto noted the Accountant's access to the lead pipe, as it was a maintenance tool kept in the hall, and her frustration with Hunter's constant push for new projects. The Accountant's presence in the hall just before the murder, discussing financial matters with students, added a layer of suspicion, though her alibi was corroborated by multiple students.

Turning to the Butler, Detecto listened as she protested her innocence, claiming she was in the conservatory tending to the plants when the murder occurred. Her habit of humming a tune while working and noticing a ladybug on a leaf seemed innocuous, yet Detecto couldn't ignore the proximity of the conservatory to the hall. However, he found no evidence linking her to the lead pipe, as she had no access to the hall during the confrontation.

The Farmer's nervous demeanor caught Detecto's attention as she recounted her story, insisting on her innocence. Detecto observed her feelings of being overshadowed by Hunter's popularity, a jealousy that had festered over time. The detective noted the Farmer's access to the lead pipe and her presence in the hall during the late evening, when Hunter was vulnerable to attack. Her mention of a spider spinning a web in her bedroom and the ticking clock during a meeting seemed trivial, yet Detecto sensed a deeper turmoil within her.

The Priest, with his enthusiastic yet nervous manner, described a tense conversation with Hunter about her plans for a new chapel, which he believed would disrupt the school's traditions. Detecto noticed the Priest's frustration with Hunter's plans and his access to the lead pipe, as he oversaw maintenance supplies in the hall. The Priest's presence in the hall during the meeting when Hunter was attacked, distracted by students, added to the complexity of the case.

As Detecto pieced together the stories, he noted the Accountant's anecdote about burning cookies for a school event, a detail that seemed to humanize her amidst the tension. The Butler's observation of the Farmer's nervousness and the lack of evidence linking her to the weapon further complicated the investigation. The Farmer's admission of dropping the pipe back where it was and trying to act shocked like everyone else lingered in Detecto's mind.

The Priest's nervous demeanor and earlier argument with Hunter made him appear suspicious, yet his protests of innocence echoed those of the others. Detecto's mind raced as he considered the evidence, knowing that one of these suspects was the killer. With a keen eye for detail and a mind honed for deduction, Detecto was ready to reveal the truth, confident in his understanding of the tangled web of motives and opportunities.

## Question

Given the story you have just read, who is guilty of killing Hunter?

Only one character had motive, means, and opportunity, and the other characters have successfully demonstrated their innocence.

## Choices

- A: Butler
- B: Farmer
- C: Accountant
- D: Priest

## Correct Answer

The killer is Farmer

## Reasoning

- [AFTER_CRIME]	The detective finds no evidence linking Butler to the lead pipe or any other weapon, as she had no access to the hall during the confrontation. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Butler)
- [DURING_CRIME]	When the murder occurred, Priest was in the hall, mingling with a group of students. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Priest)
- [DURING_CRIME]	The detective finds that Accountant was seen by multiple students in the hall at the time of the murder, corroborating her alibi. (PROVES_INNOCENCE for Accountant)
- [NARRATIVE]	Note: Only one character had a means, motive, and opportunity.
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Farmer felt overshadowed by Hunter's popularity and success at the boarding school. Hunter often received praise for her teaching methods and rapport with students, which made Farmer feel inadequate and resentful. This jealousy festered over time, leading Farmer to believe that removing Hunter would elevate her own standing within the school. (MOTIVE -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Farmer)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	The murder was committed using a lead pipe, which was typically used for maintenance in the school's hall. It was heavy and could deliver a fatal blow, making it an effective weapon for someone looking to commit a crime of passion. (MEANS -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Farmer)
- [CONCEALED] [BEFORE_CRIME]	Hunter was vulnerable to attack during the late evening when most of the other staff members were occupied with their own activities. The hall was dimly lit, and Hunter had just finished a meeting with students, making her an easy target as she walked alone toward her office. (OPPORTUNITY -- SUGGESTS_GUILT for Farmer)

As the school descends into chaos and suspicion, Detective Detecto must unravel the truth among a cast of eccentric characters, while the killer lurks in their midst.

### Parsed Crime Story

Means: The murder was committed using a lead pipe, which was typically used for maintenance in the school's hall. It was heavy and could deliver a fatal blow, making it an effective weapon for someone looking to commit a crime of passion.
Motive: Farmer felt overshadowed by Hunter's popularity and success at the boarding school. Hunter often received praise for her teaching methods and rapport with students, which made Farmer feel inadequate and resentful. This jealousy festered over time, leading Farmer to believe that removing Hunter would elevate her own standing within the school.
Opportunity: Hunter was vulnerable to attack during the late evening when most of the other staff members were occupied with their own activities. The hall was dimly lit, and Hunter had just finished a meeting with students, making her an easy target as she walked alone toward her office.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Farmer was in her bedroom, pacing back and forth, feeling the weight of her jealousy and frustration. She had overheard a group of students praising Hunter for her latest project, which only deepened her feelings of inadequacy. As the evening wore on, she stewed in her thoughts, contemplating how Hunter's presence overshadowed her own contributions to the school. Eventually, she decided to confront Hunter, hoping to express her grievances and perhaps gain some recognition for her own work.

The murder occurred in the hall, where the lighting was low and shadows danced along the walls. Farmer approached Hunter as she exited the meeting, her heart racing with a mix of anger and fear. In a moment of heated confrontation, Farmer grabbed the lead pipe that was propped against the wall, a tool used for maintenance. In a fit of rage, she struck Hunter, who was caught off guard and unable to defend herself. The blow was swift and brutal, leaving Hunter lifeless on the floor.

Afterward, Farmer panicked. She quickly dropped the lead pipe back in its place and hurried to the conservatory, where she tried to compose herself. She took a few deep breaths, attempting to calm her racing heart. When the commotion began, and others rushed to the hall, Farmer feigned shock and horror, blending in with the chaos while carefully observing the reactions of the other characters, all the while hiding her own guilt.


Story to Detective: 


I was in my bedroom before the incident, just trying to gather my thoughts. I had heard the students talking about Hunter and how wonderful she was, and it really got to me. I felt like I was always in her shadow, no matter how hard I worked. I thought maybe if I confronted her, I could finally express how I felt and maybe even get some recognition for my own contributions. I was nervous, but I thought it was time to stand up for myself.

When I went to the hall, I saw Hunter coming out of a meeting. I was feeling a mix of emotions—anger, frustration, and a bit of fear. I had noticed the lead pipe nearby, and in that moment, I just lost control. I didn’t plan to hurt her; it all happened so fast. I struck her, and before I knew it, she was on the ground. I was in shock, and I didn’t know what to do. I panicked and just dropped the pipe back where it was. I didn’t want anyone to think I had anything to do with it.

Afterward, I went to the conservatory to collect myself. I was terrified and didn’t know how to react when everyone started coming into the hall. I tried to act shocked, just like everyone else. I didn’t want anyone to suspect me. I was just as horrified as everyone else, and I thought if I played it cool, I could get through this. I’m innocent; I didn’t mean for any of this to happen.

### Parsed Story for Butler

Means: None.
Motive: None.
Opportunity: Butler was in the conservatory, tending to the plants, when the murder occurred.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Butler was in the conservatory, meticulously caring for the school’s collection of exotic plants. She found solace in the greenery, often losing herself in the routine of watering and pruning. As she worked, she overheard snippets of conversation from students in the hall, discussing Hunter's recent achievements. This only deepened her admiration for Farmer, who she believed deserved more recognition, but she felt too shy to voice her thoughts.

When the murder occurred, Butler was still in the conservatory, completely unaware of the chaos unfolding just a few feet away. She was focused on a particularly stubborn plant that needed extra attention. The sounds of the confrontation and the subsequent blow were muffled by the thick walls of the conservatory, and she only realized something was wrong when she heard the commotion of people rushing to the hall. 

Afterward, Butler emerged from the conservatory, her hands still dirtied from her work. She was startled to see a crowd gathering around Hunter's lifeless body. In a state of shock, she instinctively moved closer to see what had happened, her heart racing as she tried to process the scene. As others began to speculate about the murder, Butler felt a wave of panic wash over her, fearing that her proximity to the crime scene would make her a target of suspicion.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the conservatory before the murder, tending to the plants. I find it calming to work with them, and I was completely focused on my task. I heard some chatter from the hall, but I didn’t pay much attention to it. I was just trying to make sure the plants were healthy and happy. I didn’t know anything was wrong until I heard the commotion outside.

When I realized something was happening, I stepped out of the conservatory to see what was going on. I was shocked to find everyone gathered around Hunter. I felt a wave of panic because I had been so close to the hall, and I worried that people might think I had something to do with it. I didn’t see anything, and I was just as surprised as everyone else when I found out what had happened.

I want to make it clear that I had no reason to harm Hunter. I admired her work and thought she was talented. I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I can’t help but think that Farmer, who seemed so nervous, might have been involved. I noticed she was acting strangely earlier, and I wish I had said something. But I was too shy to speak up.


### Parsed Story for Priest

Means: Priest had access to the lead pipe, as he was responsible for overseeing maintenance supplies in the hall.
Motive: Priest was frustrated with Hunter's plans, believing they would change the school's values and diminish its spiritual foundation.
Opportunity: Priest was in the hall during the meeting when Hunter was attacked, but he was distracted by a group of students discussing their upcoming projects.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Priest was in the chapel, preparing for an evening service. He was reviewing his notes and practicing his speech, feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety about the upcoming event. Earlier that day, he had a tense conversation with Hunter regarding her plans for a new chapel, which he believed would disrupt the school's traditions. This argument left him feeling agitated, but he was determined to focus on his duties.

When the murder occurred, Priest was in the hall, mingling with a group of students who were discussing their projects. He was animatedly engaging with them, trying to encourage their enthusiasm, completely unaware of the confrontation between Farmer and Hunter. The sounds of the argument and the subsequent blow were drowned out by the chatter of the students, and he only became aware of the chaos when he noticed the sudden shift in the atmosphere and saw people rushing towards the hall.

After the murder, Priest rushed to the scene, his heart pounding with concern. He was horrified to see Hunter's lifeless body on the floor. In a state of shock, he began to comfort the students, trying to maintain a sense of calm amidst the chaos. However, his nervous demeanor and the earlier argument with Hunter made him appear suspicious to others, as he fumbled for words and struggled to process the situation.


Story to Detective: 


I was in the chapel preparing for the evening service when I had a rather heated discussion with Hunter earlier that day. We disagreed on her plans for a new chapel, which I felt would undermine the school's traditions. I was frustrated, but I didn't harbor any ill will toward her. I was focused on my responsibilities and wanted to ensure the service went smoothly. I was in the hall when the murder happened, speaking with a group of students about their projects. I was completely engrossed in their excitement and had no idea that anything was wrong.

When I heard the commotion, I rushed to the hall, and my heart sank at the sight of Hunter's body. I was horrified and immediately tried to comfort the students who were in shock. I must admit, my nervousness made me appear more agitated than I felt. I didn't know what to do, and I was overwhelmed by the chaos around me. I was merely trying to help, but I realize now that my actions may have seemed suspicious.

I want to assure you that I had no motive to harm Hunter. Yes, we had our disagreements, but I would never resort to violence. I was merely trying to fulfill my duties as a priest and support the students. I understand that my earlier argument with Hunter may raise questions, but I hope you can see that I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and my intentions were never malicious.


### Parsed Story for Accountant

Means: Accountant had access to the lead pipe, as it was a maintenance tool kept in the hall.
Motive: Accountant felt frustrated with Hunter's constant push for new projects that required funding, which she believed would jeopardize the school's financial stability. However, this frustration did not translate into a desire to kill.
Opportunity: Accountant was in the hall just before the murder, discussing financial matters with a group of students, making her presence at the scene suspicious.

Real Story: 


Before the murder, Accountant was in her office, poring over financial reports and preparing for a meeting with the school's board. She was grumbling about the budget cuts and the pressure from Hunter to allocate funds for her latest project. This frustration boiled over when she had a brief but heated argument with Hunter earlier in the day, where she expressed her concerns about the school's financial future.

When the murder occurred, Accountant was in the hall, surrounded by a group of students who were seeking her advice on their projects. She was animatedly discussing the importance of budgeting and financial responsibility, completely unaware of the confrontation between Farmer and Hunter. The noise of the students' chatter masked the sounds of the argument, and she only realized something was wrong when the crowd began to gather around Hunter's body.

After the murder, Accountant was one of the first to rush to the scene, her booming voice cutting through the chaos as she tried to assess the situation. She felt a wave of panic as she saw Hunter lying lifeless on the floor, and her mind raced with thoughts of how her earlier argument might make her look suspicious. In her haste, she began to question the students about what they had seen, trying to gather information while also appearing concerned.


Story to Detective: 


I was in my office before the murder, going through financial reports and preparing for a meeting. I had a disagreement with Hunter earlier that day about budget cuts. She wanted to push for new projects, and I was adamant that we couldn't afford it. I was frustrated, but I never wanted her dead. I just wanted her to understand the financial implications of her decisions.

When the murder happened, I was in the hall with a group of students. They were asking me about their projects, and I was trying to emphasize the importance of budgeting. I didn't hear anything unusual because the students were quite loud, and I was focused on their questions. I only realized something was wrong when I saw people rushing towards the hall, and I followed them out of concern.

After I arrived at the scene, I was horrified to see Hunter's body. I panicked and started asking the students what they had seen. I wanted to help, but I worried that my earlier argument with Hunter would make me look guilty. I assure you, I had no motive to kill her; I just wanted to keep the school's finances in check.

The central story is that a crime was committed with a Lead Pipe in the Hall by Farmer, killing Hunter. But there's shenanigans going on with the other stuff, too. Detective Detecto is on the case!

Synopsis: In the prestigious confines of an exclusive boarding school, a laid-back woman named Hunter is brutally murdered with a lead pipe in the hall. As the school descends into chaos and suspicion, Detective Detecto must unravel the truth among a cast of eccentric characters, while the killer lurks in their midst.

Farmer's Story to the Detective: 


I was in my bedroom before the incident, just trying to gather my thoughts. I had heard the students talking about Hunter and how wonderful she was, and it really got to me. I felt like I was always in her shadow, no matter how hard I worked. I thought maybe if I confronted her, I could finally express how I felt and maybe even get some recognition for my own contributions. I was nervous, but I thought it was time to stand up for myself.

When I went to the hall, I saw Hunter coming out of a meeting. I was feeling a mix of emotions—anger, frustration, and a bit of fear. I had noticed the lead pipe nearby, and in that moment, I just lost control. I didn’t plan to hurt her; it all happened so fast. I struck her, and before I knew it, she was on the ground. I was in shock, and I didn’t know what to do. I panicked and just dropped the pipe back where it was. I didn’t want anyone to think I had anything to do with it.

Afterward, I went to the conservatory to collect myself. I was terrified and didn’t know how to react when everyone started coming into the hall. I tried to act shocked, just like everyone else. I didn’t want anyone to suspect me. I was just as horrified as everyone else, and I thought if I played it cool, I could get through this. I’m innocent; I didn’t mean for any of this to happen.

Butler's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the conservatory before the murder, tending to the plants. I find it calming to work with them, and I was completely focused on my task. I heard some chatter from the hall, but I didn’t pay much attention to it. I was just trying to make sure the plants were healthy and happy. I didn’t know anything was wrong until I heard the commotion outside.

When I realized something was happening, I stepped out of the conservatory to see what was going on. I was shocked to find everyone gathered around Hunter. I felt a wave of panic because I had been so close to the hall, and I worried that people might think I had something to do with it. I didn’t see anything, and I was just as surprised as everyone else when I found out what had happened.

I want to make it clear that I had no reason to harm Hunter. I admired her work and thought she was talented. I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I can’t help but think that Farmer, who seemed so nervous, might have been involved. I noticed she was acting strangely earlier, and I wish I had said something. But I was too shy to speak up.


Priest's Story to the Detective: 


I was in the chapel preparing for the evening service when I had a rather heated discussion with Hunter earlier that day. We disagreed on her plans for a new chapel, which I felt would undermine the school's traditions. I was frustrated, but I didn't harbor any ill will toward her. I was focused on my responsibilities and wanted to ensure the service went smoothly. I was in the hall when the murder happened, speaking with a group of students about their projects. I was completely engrossed in their excitement and had no idea that anything was wrong.

When I heard the commotion, I rushed to the hall, and my heart sank at the sight of Hunter's body. I was horrified and immediately tried to comfort the students who were in shock. I must admit, my nervousness made me appear more agitated than I felt. I didn't know what to do, and I was overwhelmed by the chaos around me. I was merely trying to help, but I realize now that my actions may have seemed suspicious.

I want to assure you that I had no motive to harm Hunter. Yes, we had our disagreements, but I would never resort to violence. I was merely trying to fulfill my duties as a priest and support the students. I understand that my earlier argument with Hunter may raise questions, but I hope you can see that I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and my intentions were never malicious.


Accountant's Story to the Detective: 


I was in my office before the murder, going through financial reports and preparing for a meeting. I had a disagreement with Hunter earlier that day about budget cuts. She wanted to push for new projects, and I was adamant that we couldn't afford it. I was frustrated, but I never wanted her dead. I just wanted her to understand the financial implications of her decisions.

When the murder happened, I was in the hall with a group of students. They were asking me about their projects, and I was trying to emphasize the importance of budgeting. I didn't hear anything unusual because the students were quite loud, and I was focused on their questions. I only realized something was wrong when I saw people rushing towards the hall, and I followed them out of concern.

After I arrived at the scene, I was horrified to see Hunter's body. I panicked and started asking the students what they had seen. I wanted to help, but I worried that my earlier argument with Hunter would make me look guilty. I assure you, I had no motive to kill her; I just wanted to keep the school's finances in check.

#### Assignment

Each element in the outline should be converted into exactly one sentence (or dialog with an introduction). I want you to take this list and make it flow. The story you write should start with Detective Detecto's arrival, and be structured as Detecto's revelations as he investigates. The story you write will end just before Detecto announces who did it.

Everything should be narrated from Detecto's point of view, recounted in dialog and description by interviewing the assembled characters.
Remember that Detecto doesn't have any special knowledge of what really occurred, and we see things only through the detective's eyes.
Some items in the outline were concealed from the detective, meaning the character didn't outright say them. However, the detective was able to figure it out. For each of these, you should write a sentence or two describing what gave the character away, and how the detective figured it out.
The Detective does not pass judgement until the end of the story, and refrains from pronouncing anyone guilty or innocent throughout their retelling, only describing the evidence.
The detective reveals clues to the reader, but does not help the reader draw conclusions.

Write nothing except for a story. Write a short story which closely follows my outline, one sentence per bullet point.

### Full Prose

Detective Detecto arrived at the exclusive boarding school, his curly hair slightly tousled by the brisk wind, to find Hunter's lifeless body sprawled on the floor of the hall, a lead pipe lying ominously nearby, stained with blood. The scene was grim, and the detective's suspicious eyes scanned the room, noting the presence of four individuals: the Accountant, the Priest, the Butler, and the Farmer. No one else could possibly have been there, and Detecto knew that the truth lay among these four.

Detecto began his investigation by questioning the Accountant, who admitted to having a brief but heated argument with Hunter earlier in the day. Despite her protests of innocence, Detecto noted the Accountant's access to the lead pipe, as it was a maintenance tool kept in the hall, and her frustration with Hunter's constant push for new projects. The Accountant's presence in the hall just before the murder, discussing financial matters with students, added a layer of suspicion, though her alibi was corroborated by multiple students.

Turning to the Butler, Detecto listened as she protested her innocence, claiming she was in the conservatory tending to the plants when the murder occurred. Her habit of humming a tune while working and noticing a ladybug on a leaf seemed innocuous, yet Detecto couldn't ignore the proximity of the conservatory to the hall. However, he found no evidence linking her to the lead pipe, as she had no access to the hall during the confrontation.

The Farmer's nervous demeanor caught Detecto's attention as she recounted her story, insisting on her innocence. Detecto observed her feelings of being overshadowed by Hunter's popularity, a jealousy that had festered over time. The detective noted the Farmer's access to the lead pipe and her presence in the hall during the late evening, when Hunter was vulnerable to attack. Her mention of a spider spinning a web in her bedroom and the ticking clock during a meeting seemed trivial, yet Detecto sensed a deeper turmoil within her.

The Priest, with his enthusiastic yet nervous manner, described a tense conversation with Hunter about her plans for a new chapel, which he believed would disrupt the school's traditions. Detecto noticed the Priest's frustration with Hunter's plans and his access to the lead pipe, as he oversaw maintenance supplies in the hall. The Priest's presence in the hall during the meeting when Hunter was attacked, distracted by students, added to the complexity of the case.

As Detecto pieced together the stories, he noted the Accountant's anecdote about burning cookies for a school event, a detail that seemed to humanize her amidst the tension. The Butler's observation of the Farmer's nervousness and the lack of evidence linking her to the weapon further complicated the investigation. The Farmer's admission of dropping the pipe back where it was and trying to act shocked like everyone else lingered in Detecto's mind.

The Priest's nervous demeanor and earlier argument with Hunter made him appear suspicious, yet his protests of innocence echoed those of the others. Detecto's mind raced as he considered the evidence, knowing that one of these suspects was the killer. With a keen eye for detail and a mind honed for deduction, Detecto was ready to reveal the truth, confident in his understanding of the tangled web of motives and opportunities.
